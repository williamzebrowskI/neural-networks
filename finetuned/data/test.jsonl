{"text": "Q: I can't get into my fafsa account because I can't do the two-step verification\nA: Two-step verification helps protect your account. When you log in, you'll be asked to provide a one-time code that you'll receive through email, text, or an authenticator app. If one of the methods isn't working, try a different method. You'll also receive a backup code when you enable two-step verification, which lets you access your account. If you don't have your backup code, contact the FSA help center: https://studentaid.gov/help-center/contact"}
{"text": "Q: the fafsa id, is it just my login? and can i fill out the fafsa  form at any point today\nA: The FSA ID is a username and password that you create. It's used to verify your identity and is needed to fill out the FAFSA. Creating an FSA ID is the first step to filling out the FAFSA. Remember, you and your parent(s) need separate FSA IDs. Verifying your FSA ID can take a few days, so don't wait!\n\nPro tip: You can also use your email or phone number in place of your username. "}
{"text": "Q: Why does the fafsa want me to invite my parents this year\nA: Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section. Because the FAFSA has switched to role-based completion, each contributor needs to be invited to your FAFSA. This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}
{"text": "Q: i'm stuck on the sign and submit section. when we enter my parents account information to sign it, it says the account does not match their records. but when we created the account an email was never sent to verify the account\nA: Don't worry! If you need to edit your name, social security number, date of birth, email, or phone number associated with your FSA ID, you can log in and edit it by going to https://fafsa.gov/ and clicking 'Settings' on your dashboard. Make sure your Social Security number and name match your Social Security card and your date of birth is correct."}
{"text": "Q: what if i have over 20 colleges i'm applying for\nA: To add a college to your list, you can search for it by state, city and/or name. The FAFSA will tell whether your state requires you to list colleges in a particular order and give you the option to change the order. Colleges can't see the other schools on your FAFSA or the order in which you list them. You can list up to 20 colleges. To add more you should submit the FAFSA and swap out the colleges after receiving the FAFSA Submission Summary."}
{"text": "Q: my college wants a copy of my ID Is this standard practice\nA: A college may ask for a passport or driver's license to prove your identity or confirm your citizenship as part of the verification process. If colleges ask you to show up in person with these documents and you are unable to, you can ask if they'll accept a notarized signed statement and copies of any documents. Never send colleges original copies of any documents."}
{"text": "Q: Heard I can get money bc my dad died working as a firefighter. is that true\nA: If your parent was killed in the line of duty as an active member of the armed forces after 9/11/2001 or while working as a public safety officer (police officer, firefighter, or emergency service worker), you may be automatically eligible to receive a full Pell Grant. You will need to talk to your college(s) and provide any requested documentation."}
{"text": "Q: can i still sign up of financial aid\nA: The FAFSA is open now! If you plan to go to college beginning in fall 2024, you should complete the 2024-25 application. If you plan to attend college in the Spring of 2024, you should fill out the 2023-24 FAFSA. Fill it out ASAP at https://fafsa.gov, and let me know if you have any questions along the way."}
{"text": "Q: Checking if your spouse completed their section\nA: Log into fafsa.gov and select 'FAFSA Form 2024-25' in the 'My Activity' section. Scroll down to 'Your Contributors' to see the status of their section. When the last contributor to complete the section submits your FAFSA, you will receive a confirmation email. If you don't see anything in the 'My Activity' section, try using a different browser."}
{"text": "Q: Do you need both parents signature\nA: To sign the FAFSA, you need to complete your section. Once you agree to terms, you can click 'sign'. The last contributor to complete their section will see the option to 'sign & submit.' It cannot be submitted until contributors complete their section. Your form will only stay in the system for 45 days if inactive and not submitted. If completing a paper FAFSA, both you and your contributor(s) will need to sign the form and mail it to the address listed."}

{"text": "Q: I didn't get asked about income, did I miss a section\nA: You might not see any or only see very few financial questions on the FAFSA. Due to the new consent process, the IRS shares most income and tax information directly with the FAFSA, so you don't need to answer the questions. In addition, if you receive federal benefits or your income is below a certain amount, the FAFSA will automatically skip any questions about your assets."}
{"text": "Q: Does my parent need a separate FSA ID too\nA: If you are applying as a dependent, you and your parent(s) will need separate FSA IDs to complete your respective section. The FAFSA will help you identify which parent(s) you must invite to complete the parent section. If you are applying as an independent, only you need to fill out and sign the FAFSA. The FSA ID acts as your legal signature and what you'll use to log into and complete the FAFSA each year. This is a unique ID and cannot be shared.\n\nTo create one, go to https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch"}
{"text": "Q: can i change the schools i listed on the fafsa\nA: You can add colleges once you receive your FAFSA Submission Summary.

{"text": "Q: can i fill out the fafsa if i'm an eligible noncitizen\nA: If you're an eligible noncitizen, you can receive federal student aid.

Eligible noncitizens include students who are permanent residents (have a green card), students with certain designations on their arrival-departure record (I-94), and students with specific visas - review the complete list here: https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens"}
{"text": "Q: Should I report my aid from last year as income on my renewal FAFSA\nA: You should NOT report the financial aid you received last year as income on your FAFSA. If it is included in your adjusted gross income (AGI), you should report the scholarship amount included in the 'Amount of College Grants, Scholarships, or Americorp Benefits Reported as Income to the IRS' question. Reporting it on the FAFSA ensures it won't impact the financial aid you can receive for next year."}
{"text": "Q: Do they actually need my consent or are they going to do it anyway\nA: Consent is when you give permission for the IRS to share your federal tax information with the FAFSA. It is required to receive federal financial aid, and it makes the FAFSA easier to fill out. It ensures the income and tax information is accurate and limits the income and tax questions you must answer. You need to consent even if you don't file taxes. You will see a consent overview page on the FAFSA, you must click the 'approve' button to consent."}
{"text": "Q: Does rollovers have to be reported on my FAFSA\nA: A rollover is when money or assets are transferred from one retirement plan and contributed to another. If an IRA or pension distribution is a rollover, on your 2022 1040 tax form it should say \"Rollover\" to the left of lines 4b or 5b. If you see a rollover on the tax form, you should report the amount on the FAFSA. If both of these lines are blank on your tax form, you should report 0 for both questions about rollovers. "}
{"text": "Q: I have a husband, does he need to register for an account too\nA: If you and your spouse filed 2022 taxes as Married filing jointly only you will need an FSA ID. If you and your spouse did not file taxes in 2022 or filed taxes separately, both of you will need an FSA ID.\n\nFSA IDs cannot be shared. The FSA ID acts as your legal signature and what you'll use to log into and complete the FAFSA each year."}

Fill it out ASAP at https://fafsa.gov."}
{"text": "Q: how is a grant different from a loan\nA: Good question. A grant is money you don't have to pay back. A loan is money you borrow and eventually pay back with interest."}
{"text": "Q: slow connection to the server\nA: The 2024-25 FAFSA is experiencing some technical issues. If you are unable to move past certain questions, you can try using a different device/browser or try again later. If it continues not to work, you have the option to delete the form and start over. If your form gets submitted with missing info, you'll need to fix those errors once it processes.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, contact FSA at https://studentaid.gov/help-center/contact"}
{"text": "Q: Did my parents receive EITC\nA: The Earned Income Tax Credit (EIC) is a tax credit from the IRS that you can receive if you are working and have earned income below a certain amount. You can determine if an EIC was received by looking at line 27 on the 2022 1040 tax forms. If there is an amount greater than 0 on line 27, an EIC was received, and you should say 'Yes' if asked on the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: I'm not sure who to put for the number in college. I'll be in college and so will my mom and sister\nA: The number in college should include you and your siblings and anyone else in your parent's household who will attend college in 2024-25 more than half-time. Do not count them if they'll attend a U.S. Service Academy. Do NOT count your parent(s). The number you report for this question will not change your federal financial aid eligibility. However, colleges may use it to help determine the institutional aid they can offer you."}
{"text": "Q: I need help doing my part\nA: Tell me more about what you're having trouble with. You can say things like \"I lost my FSA ID\" or \"I don't know who to put down as my parent.\""}
