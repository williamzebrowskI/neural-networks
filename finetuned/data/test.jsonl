{"prompt": "last year I had to provide my housing for colleges, but I don't see that question", "completions": "The FAFSA no longer asks for your housing status for each college you are applying to. Colleges will likely follow up to understand where you will be living while attending their college. It is really important to respond if you receive any requests from the college asking about housing. This will help make your financial aid offers more accurate when you receive them. Always check to make sure the college has the correct housing status for you. "}
{"prompt": "i'm stuck on the part where my mom has to sign digitally", "completions": "To submit the FAFSA, all contributors need to have completed and signed their sections. If you still need a contributor (parent or spouse) to complete their section, ensure their information (name, date of birth, SSN, and email) is correct. The FAFSA sends a reminder every 7 days, but you should tell them that you can only submit once they complete their section of the FAFSA. "}
{"prompt": "where can i start the fafsa", "completions": "Great job getting started! Go to https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch and create an FSA ID. Then, start gathering the necessary documents and information. Use this FAFSA checklist to help: https://www.uaspire.org/FAFSA. Once you are ready you can go to https://fafsa.gov to start your FAFSA application. If you need a paper copy of the FAFSA it is available in English and Spanish at https://studentaid.gov/forms-library/."}
{"prompt": "do i have to renew my fafsa every year", "completions": "FAFSA renewal is the process of resubmitting your FAFSA each year you plan to attend college, which is a crucial step to accessing financial aid. To renew your FAFSA, go to https://fafsa.gov, log in with your FSA ID, and start the 24-25 FAFSA. You may notice the FAFSA looks different from last year, and some questions have changed. Don't worry! These changes are due to updates Federal Student Aid is making to improve the FAFSA."}
{"prompt": "i can't get my parents to help me. can i do it without them", "completions": "If you can, you should encourage your parents to provide their information so you can be considered for as many sources of aid as possible! Your parents won't be required to pay for your college, and it doesn't put them at any risk.\n\nIf they refuse, you may only be able to apply for a direct unsubsidized loan. Follow the guidance here: https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/parent-info#unwilling-parents"}
{"prompt": "does my legal guardian need an fsa id", "completions": "Legal guardianship is when someone other than your parents is appointed your guardian. If you are under legal guardianship, you should have a court document that shows this decision. No parent or legal guardian information will be required when completing the FAFSA, and you'll be considered an independent student. If asked, you may need a copy of court documents to show your college(s)."}
{"prompt": "What should I do if the high school I go to isn't coming up", "completions": "You should list the name of the high school where you will receive your HS diploma. If your high school isn't listed, after searching, you will have the option to enter your HS information manually."}
{"prompt": "to apply for a scholarship, I need to submit a tax transcript", "completions": "A tax transcript is a record of what you submitted on your tax forms to the IRS. You can request tax transcripts, including Verification of Non-Filing, here: https://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript. To access this service, you will need an ID.me account. If you do not have one already, go to https://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript to start the process. Here is a video on how to create an IRS account: https://vimeo.com/635579276/2b7344fc06"}
{"prompt": "I was born in vermont - when did I become a resident", "completions": "Your state of legal residence is where your permanent home is. If you go to school in a state different from your home state, be sure to list the home state, not the state you attend school in. If you live separately from your parent(s) for another reason, list your home address. \n\nFor the date of residence, you should list the month and year that you moved to the state. If you were born in that state, you should list the month and year you were born."}
{"prompt": "For the fafsa renewal, should i report the financial aid i received last year as income", "completions": "You should NOT report the financial aid you received last year as income on your FAFSA. If it is included in your adjusted gross income (AGI), you should report the scholarship amount included in the 'Amount of College Grants, Scholarships, or Americorp Benefits Reported as Income to the IRS' question. Reporting it on the FAFSA ensures it won't impact the financial aid you can receive for next year."}
{"prompt": "Nothing at this moment thank you", "completions": "Thanks for chatting. Reply here if you need anything else. You can also go to the FAFSA\u00ae Help website at https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/help. Bye!"}
{"prompt": "What specific tax data is disclosed by the IRS", "completions": "If you filed 2022 taxes, the IRS will share specific lines from the tax form, like adjusted gross income, income tax paid, and several others. If you didn't file taxes, the IRS will share that they have no information on file for you. Either way, you and any other contributors should provide consent for the IRS to share federal tax information with your FAFSA. Consenting will ensure you are eligible for federal financial aid."}
{"prompt": "what if my parent doesn't have security number", "completions": "You should only create an FSA ID without an SSN if you're the parent or spouse of a student applying for financial aid OR a citizen of the freely associated states. You will need your name, DOB, email, and mailing address. Knowledge-based identity questions and additional documents may be required. You can use the FSA ID immediately after creating it. To invite a contributor without an SSN to a FAFSA, the mailing address must match the one in their FSA ID."}
{"prompt": "how long does it take for a signature to be mailed", "completions": "Once your FAFSA is signed and submitted, you will see a confirmation page or email that will provide your SAI and estimated federal aid eligibility. To check the status of your FAFSA, go to the 'My Activity' section at https://fafsa.gov. If you are dependent, your application can't be submitted until your parent(s) complete and sign their section. If you submitted a paper FAFSA please note that they will begin processing paper forms by the end of June."}
{"prompt": "If I'm a dual enrollment student, what grade level should I select on the FAFSA", "completions": "You cannot get financial aid to pay for dual enrollment courses because the FAFSA considers DE a part of high school. If you're a DE student applying to attend college after you graduate from HS, select 'First Year Undergraduate (freshman)' as your college grade level."}
{"prompt": "the college application process", "completions": "Applying to college and filling out the FAFSA are different. College applications determine if you will be accepted into a college or university. The FAFSA assesses your eligibility for federal aid to help pay for college. Once you file the FAFSA, you'll need to apply to the colleges you have chosen if you haven't already. If you indicated on the Common App that you are interested in 'need-based aid,' then you should definitely fill out the FAFSA."}
{"prompt": "I forgot all the schools I included on my FAFSA", "completions": "Once your FAFSA is processed and you've received your FAFSA Submission Summary, you can see the colleges that have received your FAFSA on the School Information tab. You can access it on your dashboard at https://fafsa.gov. If you need to add colleges, you can do this in your dashboard's 'My Activity' section by selecting 'Add or remove schools' from the 'Actions' menu. Try a different browser if you don't see anything in the 'My Activity' section."}
{"prompt": "Should I report child support that wasn't received", "completions": "Child support received is included in the asset section of the FAFSA. This means it has less impact on your student aid index than if included in the income section. You should only report the total amount received for the last full calendar year."}
{"prompt": "Can i still turn it in early march", "completions": "You should fill it out as soon as possible! Each state and college has its own deadline and many are in early 2024. Usually, the college deadline is the earliest. The date you first submit the FAFSA is the date used to meet these deadlines even if you need to go back and make corrections later. Check the college website for their deadline and check out your state deadlines here: https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/fafsa-deadlines."}
{"prompt": "I agreed to skip tax questions by giving consent, so why am I still seeing them", "completions": "If you provided consent on the FAFSA but still need to answer tax questions, it could be for a few different reasons. Two common examples are your FSA ID was just created and needs to be verified, or you filed married filing jointly in 2022 but now file differently. As long as you provided consent, having to answer income and tax questions is not a cause for concern."}
{"prompt": "I didn't go to high school. I was home schooled", "completions": "You should select the option that best represents your high school completion status by the time you enroll in college. Even if you are unsure whether you will complete HS, select the option you would receive if you were to complete it. If you are homeschooled, you will have the option to select that."}
{"prompt": "I will do it this weekend", "completions": "Got it. Don't lose time - set aside time to get started soon! And if you need any help, you can always ask me a question."}
{"prompt": "Am I citizen of the United States", "completions": "You are a U.S. citizen if you were born within the United States or born outside of the United States to U.S. citizen parents. You can also be a U.S. citizen if you have applied for citizenship and received it via naturalization. If you need to prove citizenship for financial aid, a U.S. passport, birth certificate, and social security card will usually help.  "}
{"prompt": "I'm feeling hopeless", "completions": "You are not alone. Text HOME to 741741 to reach a trained Crisis Counselor and get free, 24/7 support. Standard messaging rates apply. You can also find help at https://crisistextline.org\n\nIf you feel you're in immediate danger, please call 911."}
{"prompt": "My FAFSA needs corrections", "completions": "You can make corrections after you've received a FAFSA Submission Summary. Corrections include fixing incorrect info or adding missing info or signatures. You can either click 'Make a Correction' in the FAFSA form answers section of the FAFSA Submission Summary OR Select 'Make Corrections' on the 'My Activity' page. All colleges listed on your FAFSA will receive the updated information. "}
{"prompt": "when i apply for fafsa does it automatically go to the schools i put", "completions": "To add a college to your list, you can search for it by state, city and/or name. The FAFSA will tell whether your state requires you to list colleges in a particular order and give you the option to change the order. Colleges can't see the other schools on your FAFSA or the order in which you list them. You can list up to 20 colleges. To add more you should submit the FAFSA and swap out the colleges after receiving the FAFSA Submission Summary."}
{"prompt": "nothing right now", "completions": "Thanks for chatting. Reply here if you need anything else. You can also go to the FAFSA\u00ae Help website at https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/help. Bye!"}
