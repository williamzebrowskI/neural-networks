{"text": "Q: Does the student file a 1040 form\nA: If you earned some money in 2022 but didn't file taxes, you will NOT need to report it on your FAFSA. You won't need your W-2 to report any information. If you did file taxes, the IRS will share your income/tax information directly if you provided your consent when starting the FAFSA. Whether you filed taxes or not, you should consent so the IRS can share your information with the FAFSA. This consent is mandatory to qualify for federal financial aid."}
{"text": "Q: I didn't get SAI, it need signature\nA: The student aid index (SAI) is a number based on the info submitted on the FAFSA. It determines your eligibility for federal financial aid (like the Pell Grant). If the confirmation email says your SAI can't be calculated or your FAFSA Submission Summary doesn't list one, you'll need to check for errors and make a correction (ex: provide a missing signature) and resubmit. Your SAI is in the 'Eligibility Overview' section on the FAFSA Submission Summary."}
