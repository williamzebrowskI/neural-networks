Fill it out ASAP at https://fafsa.gov."}
{"prompt": "Do pregnant people count as independent", "completions": "Being pregnant does not automatically make you independent on the FAFSA.

{"prompt": "i just created an account for my daughter as the student. do i need to create an fsa id as well and if so where do i go or do i put her info in to just start the application", "completions": "If you are applying as a dependent, you and your parent(s) will need separate FSA IDs to complete your respective section. The FAFSA will help you identify which parent(s) you must invite to complete the parent section. If you are applying as an independent, only you need to fill out and sign the FAFSA. The FSA ID acts as your legal signature and what you'll use to log into and complete the FAFSA each year. This is a unique ID and cannot be shared.\n\nTo create one, go to https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch"}
{"prompt": "Can I Use 2018 tax return instead of 2019", "completions": "If you or any other required contributors (parent(s) or spouse) do not plan to file taxes, consent is still required on the FAFSA to be eligible for federal financial aid. If taxes won't be filed income will NOT need to be reported on the FAFSA. However, you'll need to answer a question about why taxes weren't filed.\n\n If you still need to file your tax return you should still consent to the IRS sharing your federal tax info and complete the FAFSA."}
{"prompt": "I'm a student right", "completions": "If you are a student filling out the FAFSA, select that you are a student. Selecting your role (whether you are a student or parent) at the beginning of the form helps determine what questions the FAFSA asks you."}
{"prompt": "What will I need to provide my school for verification", "completions": "The types of forms you need to fill out for verification will vary based on what information the college is asking for. You may need to provide income information, a list of those included in your family size, or even proof of citizenship. Each college has their own forms, and you will need to complete verification at each college that requests it. Check your email and college portal (if you have one) for any verification requests.  "}

{"prompt": "What do I do if I didn't file taxes", "completions": "If you or any other required contributors (parent(s) or spouse) do not plan to file taxes, consent is still required on the FAFSA to be eligible for federal financial aid. If taxes won't be filed income will NOT need to be reported on the FAFSA.

{"prompt": "will my financial aid package be the same this year", "completions": "Financial aid can change yearly depending on the info you report on your financial aid forms, your college's financial aid practices, your grades and attendance, and other factors. For example, if your income from 2022 is lower than 2021, your SAI may decrease, meaning you may be eligible for more financial aid than last year. If you're offered less financial aid on your award letter than last year, talk to your college to understand why."}
{"prompt": "can you define ward of the court", "completions": "Ward of the court is a specific designation that gives the court guardianship and removes parental rights. If you are or have been a ward of the court at any time since turning 13, you won't need to provide parent information and will be considered independent on the FAFSA. If asked, you may need a copy of the court order to show your college(s)."}
{"prompt": "do i just do one form for all colleges", "completions": "To add a college to your list, you can search for it by state, city and/or name. The FAFSA will tell whether your state requires you to list colleges in a particular order and give you the option to change the order.

To add more you should submit the FAFSA and swap out the colleges after receiving the FAFSA Submission Summary."}
{"prompt": "Where can I find the amount of scholarships on my tax form", "completions": "You would only have a scholarship reported on your taxes if you or someone in your household was in college in 2022 and received a scholarship that was considered taxable income. Taxable scholarships can appear in two places on the 2022 1040 tax form. Look for \"SCH\" with a dollar amount to the left of line 1a on the 1040 or line 8r on Schedule 1 (if you have one). If you see a number greater than 0 in either place, you should report it on the FAFSA."}
{"prompt": "Do both the parent and the student complete separate FAFSAs", "completions": "If you are applying as a dependent, you and your parent(s) will need separate FSA IDs to complete your respective section. The FAFSA will help you identify which parent(s) you must invite to complete the parent section. If you are applying as an independent, only you need to fill out and sign the FAFSA.

{"prompt": "What's a direct unsubsidized loan", "completions": "You should only choose to 'apply for a direct unsubsidized loan only' if you are considered a dependent student, but your parent(s) refuse to provide their information on your FAFSA. If you select this option, you will not be eligible for any other federal financial aid unless your parent(s) provide their information. You should contact your college and explain your parent's refusal to see if they would allow you to apply as an independent student. "}
{"prompt": "I don't talk to my parents because I have a legal guardian. DO i still need their info", "completions": "Legal guardianship is when someone other than your parents is appointed your guardian. If you are under legal guardianship, you should have a court document that shows this decision. No parent or legal guardian information will be required when completing the FAFSA, and you'll be considered an independent student. If asked, you may need a copy of court documents to show your college(s)."}
{"prompt": "i'm afraid that filling out the fafsa means i have to take out loans", "completions": "Filling out the FAFSA does NOT automatically put you in debt unless you choose to take out a loan. You are NOT required to take out any loans that you are offered."}
{"prompt": "can i still submit my fafsa", "completions": "You should fill it out as soon as possible! Each state and college has its own deadline and many are in early 2024. Usually, the college deadline is the earliest. The date you first submit the FAFSA is the date used to meet these deadlines even if you need to go back and make corrections later. Check the college website for their deadline and check out your state deadlines here: https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/fafsa-deadlines."}
{"prompt": "did my parent complete their section", "completions": "Log into fafsa.gov and select 'FAFSA Form 2024-25' in the 'My Activity' section.

If you don't see anything in the 'My Activity' section, try using a different browser."}
{"prompt": "should i apply to college first", "completions": "Applying to college and filling out the FAFSA are different. College applications determine if you will be accepted into a college or university. The FAFSA assesses your eligibility for federal aid to help pay for college. Once you file the FAFSA, you'll need to apply to the colleges you have chosen if you haven't already. If you indicated on the Common App that you are interested in 'need-based aid,' then you should definitely fill out the FAFSA."}
{"prompt": "What should i put for the IRA distributions question", "completions": "Untaxed portions of IRA distributions are the amount of money taken from an IRA that is not taxed for the given tax year. To find this amount, subtract line 4a from 4b on the 2022 1040 tax form. If the number is negative or there are no numbers in boxes 4a and 4b, put 0."}
{"prompt": "do you know when it's the latest hcc accepts it", "completions": "You should fill it out as soon as possible! Each state and college has its own deadline and many are in early 2024.

{"prompt": "differences between aid index and family contribution", "completions": "Student Aid Index (SAI) has replaced Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as the number the FAFSA calculates. SAI is very similar to EFC and will determine what federal financial aid you can receive; your state and college may use it too. SAI can be as low as -1,500, and it no longer considers whether you have siblings in college in the calculation. If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}
{"prompt": "Did I receive EITC", "completions": "The Earned Income Tax Credit (EIC) is a tax credit from the IRS that you can receive if you are working and have earned income below a certain amount. You can determine if an EIC was received by looking at line 27 on the 2022 1040 tax forms. If there is an amount greater than 0 on line 27, an EIC was received, and you should say 'Yes' if asked on the FAFSA."}
{"prompt": "do stocks count as assets", "completions": "Investments on the FAFSA include the net worth of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate, trust funds, and more. 529 accounts are reported if you (the student) are the beneficiary and they should be reported in the parent section. Net worth is value minus debt. Investments do *not* include retirement accounts, 529 accounts for siblings, or the home lived in unless a portion of the home is rented out. If there are no investments, enter 0s and move on."}
{"prompt": "whose taxes should I use for family size", "completions": "Family size should be updated if the number of people claimed on the 2022 taxes is different than the number currently in the household. If you are dependent, it is based on your parent(s) taxes. If you are independent, it is based on your taxes. To see who is claimed on the tax forms, count the tax filer, spouse (if applicable), and anyone in the dependent section. Here's a picture that shows where to look.\n\nIf you're unsure, update it on the FAFSA."}
{"prompt": "How do my parents find out if they meet the tax filing threshold", "completions": "The tax filing threshold is an amount of income that determines whether or not you are required to file taxes. The IRS sets a new amount annually based on age and tax filing status. Check out the 2022 tax filing threshold here: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/who-needs-to-file-a-tax-return"}
{"prompt": "i'm emancipated. how does that affect my fafsa", "completions": "Emancipation is a legal process that allows someone under 18 to no longer be under the custody of their parent(s).

{"prompt": "How do I determine what was listed my parents tax form for family size", "completions": "Family size should be updated if the number of people claimed on the 2022 taxes is different than the number currently in the household.

To see who is claimed on the tax forms, count the tax filer, spouse (if applicable), and anyone in the dependent section. Here's a picture that shows where to look.\n\nIf you're unsure, update it on the FAFSA."}
{"prompt": "The FAFSA didn't ask about my mom's assets. Did we do something wrong", "completions": "You might not see any or only see very few financial questions on the FAFSA. Due to the new consent process, the IRS shares most income and tax information directly with the FAFSA, so you don't need to answer the questions. In addition, if you receive federal benefits or your income is below a certain amount, the FAFSA will automatically skip any questions about your assets."}
{"prompt": "should i add my middle name for my FSA ID", "completions": "Don't worry! If you need to edit your name, social security number, date of birth, email, or phone number associated with your FSA ID, you can log in and edit it by going to https://fafsa.gov/ and clicking 'Settings' on your dashboard.

{"prompt": "Submission Summary vs SAR", "completions": "The FAFSA Submission Summary has replaced the Student Aid Report (SAR) as the summary of the information you put on the FAFSA.

{"prompt": "Consenting was meant to bypass tax questions.

Your responses to the asset questions won't impact your aid eligibility if your parents' income or federal benefits exempt you from reporting assets."}
{"prompt": "what do i do for my parents", "completions": "If you are a dependent student, you must get your parent(s) involved. At least one parent must create a separate FSA ID, complete their section(s), and sign the FAFSA. The FAFSA considers your parent(s) to be your legal (biological or adoptive) parent. If you're independent, you do NOT need to involve your parent(s).To determine which parent needs to be invited to your FAFSA, say \"which parent\", and I'll help you figure it out!"}
{"prompt": "Should more info transfer from last years fafsa", "completions": "Due to extensive changes to the form, no information from the 23-24 FAFSA will transfer to the 24-25 FAFSA. Some info will auto-populate from your FSA ID, but you will need to provide new answers for most questions."}
{"prompt": "Who can tell my why my financial aid changed", "completions": "Financial aid can change yearly depending on the info you report on your financial aid forms, your college's financial aid practices, your grades and attendance, and other factors. For example, if your income from 2022 is lower than 2021, your SAI may decrease, meaning you may be eligible for more financial aid than last year. If you're offered less financial aid on your award letter than last year, talk to your college to understand why."}
{"prompt": "what do i need to do next? i created an account. that's all i've done so far", "completions": "If you created an FSA ID with a SSN, it will take 1-3 days to be verified.\n\nIf a parent/contributor created an FSA ID without an SSN and successfully answered the knowledge based identity questions, it can be used immediately. If unable to confirm identity, an email will be sent with a case number and instructions to submit additional documents.

{"prompt": "i am not sure what i put for my income", "completions": "If you earned some money in 2022 but didn't file taxes, you will NOT need to report it on your FAFSA. You won't need your W-2 to report any information. If you did file taxes, the IRS will share your income/tax information directly if you provided your consent when starting the FAFSA. Whether you filed taxes or not, you should consent so the IRS can share your information with the FAFSA. This consent is mandatory to qualify for federal financial aid."}
{"prompt": "i have foster parents. do they create fsa ids", "completions": "Foster care is when a state agency places someone in a temporary home, group home, or other resident care facility. If you are in or have been in foster care at any time since turning 13, you won't need to provide parent or foster parent information and will be considered independent on the FAFSA.

{"prompt": "My dad has a farm. How does he value it for the Fafsa", "completions": "Net worth is the value of an asset minus any debt you own on that asset. To determine the net worth of a business, farm, or real estate (like a vacation home or rental property), you would take the value you could sell it for and subtract any debt. If you rent out a part of the home you live in, you only report the net worth of that part. We recommend talking to an accountant if you have questions."}
{"prompt": "will the new fafsa affect how much money I could get", "completions": "Financial aid can change yearly depending on the info you report on your financial aid forms, your college's financial aid practices, your grades and attendance, and other factors.

{"prompt": "does fafsa cover california grants and scholarship", "completions": "I only answer questions about the FAFSA.

{"prompt": "Why isn't the FAFSA asking me about housing", "completions": "The FAFSA no longer asks for your housing status for each college you are applying to. Colleges will likely follow up to understand where you will be living while attending their college.

They should try logging in even if they didn't get an email invite. If they haven't received an invite, verify the info you provided to invite them is accurate.

{"prompt": "Why doesn't the FAFSA ask for housing for each college", "completions": "The FAFSA no longer asks for your housing status for each college you are applying to. Colleges will likely follow up to understand where you will be living while attending their college. It is really important to respond if you receive any requests from the college asking about housing. This will help make your financial aid offers more accurate when you receive them. Always check to make sure the college has the correct housing status for you. "}
{"prompt": "I invited wrong parent can I change it", "completions": "If you entered an incorrect name, DOB, or SSN for a contributor, log in to the FAFSA and correct it.

Once they log in with their FSA ID, they'll see the invite to your FAFSA.\n\nIf your FAFSA was submitted with the wrong contributor, you can fix it once it processes by making a correction. It will need to be resubmitted with the new contributor's info."}
{"prompt": "do i have to report my parents' info", "completions": "If you are a dependent student, you must get your parent(s) involved. At least one parent must create a separate FSA ID, complete their section(s), and sign the FAFSA. The FAFSA considers your parent(s) to be your legal (biological or adoptive) parent. If you're independent, you do NOT need to involve your parent(s).To determine which parent needs to be invited to your FAFSA, say \"which parent\", and I'll help you figure it out!"}
{"prompt": "I want to submit my FAFSA, but my parents haven't done their section. What should I do", "completions": "To sign the FAFSA, you need to complete your section. Once you agree to terms, you can click 'sign'. The last contributor to complete their section will see the option to 'sign & submit.' It cannot be submitted until contributors complete their section. Your form will only stay in the system for 45 days if inactive and not submitted. If completing a paper FAFSA, both you and your contributor(s) will need to sign the form and mail it to the address listed."}
{"prompt": "my mom passed away last year and i live with my stepdad. whose info should i report", "completions": "I'm really sorry to hear that. If one parent has passed away, you should only report the info for your living parent.

If your biological or adoptive parents are deceased, you may apply as an independent student. Contact your financial aid offices to confirm what information you need to provide."}
{"prompt": "i'm currently living in a shelter so i'm not sure how i can fill out fafsa", "completions": "You can file the FAFSA if you're currently or at risk of experiencing homelessness.

You should download the authenticator app you want to use before starting the setup process."}
{"prompt": "I consented to the IRS so why do I have to answer tax questions", "completions": "If you provided consent on the FAFSA but still need to answer tax questions, it could be for a few different reasons. Two common examples are your FSA ID was just created and needs to be verified, or you filed married filing jointly in 2022 but now file differently. As long as you provided consent, having to answer income and tax questions is not a cause for concern."}
{"prompt": "i think my mom filled out but i don't know if she competed", "completions": "Once your FAFSA is signed and submitted, you will see a confirmation page or email that will provide your SAI and estimated federal aid eligibility.

If you don't have your backup code, contact the FSA help center: https://studentaid.gov/help-center/contact"}
{"prompt": "Did my consent successfully go through", "completions": "As long as you click the 'approve' button on the consent page of your FAFSA, you should be all set. The FAFSA won't tell you what information was shared, but after submitting, you should review the FAFSA submission summary to ensure everything was processed correctly."}
{"prompt": "how do i count my parent's college savings plan for me", "completions": "If your parent(s) have a 529 plan with you as the beneficiary, they would report it in the parent asset section of the FAFSA. They should not include any other 529 plans they have for your siblings. If a grandparent or someone else besides your parent(s) has a 529 plan for you, do not include it on your FAFSA. \n\n If you are independent on the FAFSA and have your own 529 plan, you must include it as an asset."}
{"prompt": "I didn't provide consent. What will happen", "completions": "Anyone filling out a section of your FAFSA must consent for you to be eligible for federal financial aid. Even if you or your parent(s) didn't file 2022 taxes, consent is still required. If taxes weren't filed, the IRS will share with the FAFSA that they have no tax info on file.\n\nIf you or your parent(s) don't consent, you will NOT receive federal financial aid.

{"prompt": "Should my dad select parent", "completions": "If you are a student filling out the FAFSA, select that you are a student. Selecting your role (whether you are a student or parent) at the beginning of the form helps determine what questions the FAFSA asks you."}

{"prompt": "Is my uncle a contributor", "completions": "A contributor could be a parent, stepparent, or spouse who must provide their information on your FAFSA. It does not mean they must contribute anything financially to you or pay for college. "}
{"prompt": "I've heard that none of last years info transfers over. Is that true", "completions": "Due to extensive changes to the form, no information from the 23-24 FAFSA will transfer to the 24-25 FAFSA. Some info will auto-populate from your FSA ID, but you will need to provide new answers for most questions."}
{"prompt": "is my grant from last year income", "completions": "You should NOT report the financial aid you received last year as income on your FAFSA. If it is included in your adjusted gross income (AGI), you should report the scholarship amount included in the 'Amount of College Grants, Scholarships, or Americorp Benefits Reported as Income to the IRS' question. Reporting it on the FAFSA ensures it won't impact the financial aid you can receive for next year."}
{"prompt": "last year I didn't need to invite my parents. I could just do the whole thing myself with their info", "completions": "Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section. Because the FAFSA has switched to role-based completion, each contributor needs to be invited to your FAFSA. This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}
{"prompt": "filling out the application", "completions": "Tell me more about what you're having trouble with. You can say things like \"I lost my FSA ID\" or \"I don't know who to put down as my parent.\""}

{"prompt": "where's my financial aid package", "completions": "Once colleges receive your FAFSA and you're accepted, they will send you a financial aid offer or award letter.

{"prompt": "The FAFSA skipped questions about income", "completions": "You might not see any or only see very few financial questions on the FAFSA. Due to the new consent process, the IRS shares most income and tax information directly with the FAFSA, so you don't need to answer the questions.

{"prompt": "where's my expected family contribution", "completions": "Student Aid Index (SAI) has replaced Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as the number the FAFSA calculates. SAI is very similar to EFC and will determine what federal financial aid you can receive; your state and college may use it too. SAI can be as low as -1,500, and it no longer considers whether you have siblings in college in the calculation. If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}
{"prompt": "financial support", "completions": "Financial support can include many things. To determine which parent provides more financial support, you should consider who pays for your housing, food, clothes, and any other expenses you have.

If you're still not sure you can ask your parents."}
{"prompt": "what state should I put if my parents live in a another state", "completions": "Your state of legal residence is where your permanent home is.

If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}

If you're offered less financial aid on your award letter than last year, talk to your college to understand why."}
{"prompt": "When can I submit the FAFSA", "completions": "To submit the FAFSA, all contributors need to have completed and signed their sections.

{"prompt": "Consenting on the tax form didn't exempt me from answering tax questions.

{"prompt": "what if i don't have my w-2s", "completions": "If you earned some money in 2022 but didn't file taxes, you will NOT need to report it on your FAFSA. You won't need your W-2 to report any information. If you did file taxes, the IRS will share your income/tax information directly if you provided your consent when starting the FAFSA.

If taxes won't be filed income will NOT need to be reported on the FAFSA.

{"prompt": "i am divorced and remarried. is my husband a dependent", "completions": "If you are dependent, family size includes you, your parent(s), siblings living at home or away at college and being supported by your parent(s), and anyone else that lives with and receives more than half their support from your parent(s).

{"prompt": "Do scholarships get included on FAFSA", "completions": "You should NOT report the financial aid you received last year as income on your FAFSA. If it is included in your adjusted gross income (AGI), you should report the scholarship amount included in the 'Amount of College Grants, Scholarships, or Americorp Benefits Reported as Income to the IRS' question. Reporting it on the FAFSA ensures it won't impact the financial aid you can receive for next year."}
{"prompt": "I don't see where I would report my housing decision for each school", "completions": "The FAFSA no longer asks for your housing status for each college you are applying to. Colleges will likely follow up to understand where you will be living while attending their college. It is really important to respond if you receive any requests from the college asking about housing. This will help make your financial aid offers more accurate when you receive them. Always check to make sure the college has the correct housing status for you. "}

{"prompt": "my dad lost his job", "completions": "If your or your family's income or financial situation has changed recently, still provide consent to using your 2022 tax information.

{"prompt": "Why do I have to answet tax questions", "completions": "If you provided consent on the FAFSA but still need to answer tax questions, it could be for a few different reasons.

As long as you provided consent, having to answer income and tax questions is not a cause for concern."}
{"prompt": "how do i opt out of fafsa", "completions": "Whether or not the FAFSA is required depends on the state you live in. You should check to see if your state requires you to submit the FAFSA to graduate from high school.

Contributors can complete the FAFSA with their FSA ID before it is verified, which usually takes 7-14 days."}
{"prompt": "can i just do my partner's section like i did last year", "completions": "Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section.

This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}

{"prompt": "how do i link my parents to my form", "completions": "If you are applying as a dependent, you and your parent(s) will need separate FSA IDs to complete your respective section. The FAFSA will help you identify which parent(s) you must invite to complete the parent section. If you are applying as an independent, only you need to fill out and sign the FAFSA.

{"prompt": "what happens when I consent to sharing info", "completions": "If you filed 2022 taxes, the IRS will share specific lines from the tax form, like adjusted gross income, income tax paid, and several others.

Either way, you and any other contributors should provide consent for the IRS to share federal tax information with your FAFSA. Consenting will ensure you are eligible for federal financial aid."}
{"prompt": "What can impact financial aid each year", "completions": "Financial aid can change yearly depending on the info you report on your financial aid forms, your college's financial aid practices, your grades and attendance, and other factors. For example, if your income from 2022 is lower than 2021, your SAI may decrease, meaning you may be eligible for more financial aid than last year.

{"prompt": "what do i do if i don't have my ss#", "completions": "A social security number (SSN) is a 9-digit number given by the Social Security Administration.

You cannot use your ITIN as a substitute for your SSN."}
{"prompt": "what is knowledge based verification", "completions": "For people without an SSN, knowledge-based verification questions are required to further prove identity.

{"prompt": "do i need to wait for them to accept my application", "completions": "You can submit the FAFSA before you apply to college.

If taxes weren't filed, the IRS will share with the FAFSA that they have no tax info on file.\n\nIf you or your parent(s) don't consent, you will NOT receive federal financial aid. If anyone didn't consent, they should log back in at https://fafsa.gov and provide consent."}
{"prompt": "can you explain the purpose of inviting parents", "completions": "Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section. Because the FAFSA has switched to role-based completion, each contributor needs to be invited to your FAFSA. This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}
{"prompt": "I need to print a signature page where can i find it", "completions": "To sign the FAFSA, you need to complete your section. Once you agree to terms, you can click 'sign'. The last contributor to complete their section will see the option to 'sign & submit.' It cannot be submitted until contributors complete their section. Your form will only stay in the system for 45 days if inactive and not submitted. If completing a paper FAFSA, both you and your contributor(s) will need to sign the form and mail it to the address listed."}
{"prompt": "can i apply over the summer", "completions": "You should fill it out as soon as possible! Each state and college has its own deadline and many are in early 2024.

{"prompt": "how do I know if I'm a legal resident of a state", "completions": "Your state of legal residence is where your permanent home is. If you go to school in a state different from your home state, be sure to list the home state, not the state you attend school in.

{"prompt": "what should i do if i'm about to be homeless", "completions": "You can file the FAFSA if you're currently or at risk of experiencing homelessness.

{"prompt": "why do i need to invite my husband to do the fafsa with me", "completions": "Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section.

{"prompt": "do i need a w2 form", "completions": "If you earned some money in 2022 but didn't file taxes, you will NOT need to report it on your FAFSA.

To add more you should submit the FAFSA and swap out the colleges after receiving the FAFSA Submission Summary."}

Even if you or your parent(s) didn't file 2022 taxes, consent is still required. If taxes weren't filed, the IRS will share with the FAFSA that they have no tax info on file.\n\nIf you or your parent(s) don't consent, you will NOT receive federal financial aid.

{"prompt": "where is the housing question", "completions": "The FAFSA no longer asks for your housing status for each college you are applying to.

{"prompt": "Why can't I find any colleges when I search", "completions": "If you can't find a college, make sure you have selected the correct state.

If you are returning to complete the FAFSA, click 'access existing form.' Either button will take you to the right place to start or continue your FAFSA."}

{"prompt": "Can't figure out how to finalize and submit my application", "completions": "To submit the FAFSA, all contributors need to have completed and signed their sections. If you still need a contributor (parent or spouse) to complete their section, ensure their information (name, date of birth, SSN, and email) is correct. The FAFSA sends a reminder every 7 days, but you should tell them that you can only submit once they complete their section of the FAFSA. "}
{"prompt": "i'm eligible for Pell but wasn't before, did i do something wrong", "completions": "Financial aid can change yearly depending on the info you report on your financial aid forms, your college's financial aid practices, your grades and attendance, and other factors. For example, if your income from 2022 is lower than 2021, your SAI may decrease, meaning you may be eligible for more financial aid than last year. If you're offered less financial aid on your award letter than last year, talk to your college to understand why."}
{"prompt": "my parents username isn't working. we think it's been disabled and we're not sure what to do", "completions": "If your parent(s) account is disabled, they can go in and enable their account under account information. They can do this by going to https://fafsa.gov/ and clicking 'settings' on the dashboard."}
{"prompt": "Is a phone number needed", "completions": "A phone number is not required to create an FSA ID. If you have your own mobile phone number, we recommend using it to have it as an option for two-factor authentication and password recovery."}
{"prompt": "why is child support considered an asset", "completions": "Child support received is included in the asset section of the FAFSA. This means it has less impact on your student aid index than if included in the income section. You should only report the total amount received for the last full calendar year."}
{"prompt": "How can I set up 2 factor authentication", "completions": "Two-step verification helps protect your account. When you log in, you'll be asked to provide a one-time code that you'll receive through email, text, or an authenticator app. If one of the methods isn't working, try a different method. You'll also receive a backup code when you enable two-step verification, which lets you access your account. If you don't have your backup code, contact the FSA help center: https://studentaid.gov/help-center/contact"}
{"prompt": "Where do I find the amount of money my parents paid through taxes", "completions": "Income tax paid is the amount in federal tax payments for the given tax year. You can find income tax paid on line 22 of the 2022 1040 tax form. On the FAFSA, you must subtract Schedule 2 line 2 from line 22 of the 1040. If a Schedule 2 wasn't filed, or there was no amount on line 2, report the amount on line 22 of the 1040."}
{"prompt": "Why Is consent important in these situations", "completions": "Consent is when you give permission for the IRS to share your federal tax information with the FAFSA. It is required to receive federal financial aid, and it makes the FAFSA easier to fill out. It ensures the income and tax information is accurate and limits the income and tax questions you must answer. You need to consent even if you don't file taxes. You will see a consent overview page on the FAFSA, you must click the 'approve' button to consent."}
{"prompt": "list of all the schools on my FAFSA", "completions": "Once your FAFSA is processed and you've received your FAFSA Submission Summary, you can see the colleges that have received your FAFSA on the School Information tab.

Try a different browser if you don't see anything in the 'My Activity' section."}
{"prompt": "when happens when I submit", "completions": "Once your FAFSA is signed and submitted, you will see a confirmation page or email that will provide your SAI and estimated federal aid eligibility. To check the status of your FAFSA, go to the 'My Activity' section at https://fafsa.gov. If you are dependent, your application can't be submitted until your parent(s) complete and sign their section. If you submitted a paper FAFSA please note that they will begin processing paper forms by the end of June."}
{"prompt": "I'm confused why college asked for a copy of my ID", "completions": "A college may ask for a passport or driver's license to prove your identity or confirm your citizenship as part of the verification process. If colleges ask you to show up in person with these documents and you are unable to, you can ask if they'll accept a notarized signed statement and copies of any documents. Never send colleges original copies of any documents."}
{"prompt": "last year we had to print out the signature page to submit with the fafsa", "completions": "The signature page is no longer an option for the 2024-25 FAFSA. A parent without an SSN can now create an FSA ID and use it to sign the FAFSA. If your parent cannot create an FSA ID, you can complete a paper FAFSA, have your parent(s) sign it, and mail it in. Your parent(s) will still need to verify their identify after it processes. The paper FAFSA is available in English and Spanish at https://studentaid.gov/forms-library/."}
{"prompt": "I can't get my mom to sign the form", "completions": "If you can, you should encourage your parents to provide their information so you can be considered for as many sources of aid as possible! Your parents won't be required to pay for your college, and it doesn't put them at any risk.\n\nIf they refuse, you may only be able to apply for a direct unsubsidized loan.

{"prompt": "consent to IRS tax sharing vs DRT", "completions": "The Direct Data Exchange (DDX) has replaced the IRS DRT as the way to get your federal tax information (FTI) onto your FAFSA. FTI is what the FAFSA calls the income and tax information you filed with the IRS and what the IRS will share with the FAFSA. This process is automatically completed once you consent to the DDX on the FAFSA."}
{"prompt": "why is my sai so different from my efc", "completions": "Student Aid Index (SAI) has replaced Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as the number the FAFSA calculates. SAI is very similar to EFC and will determine what federal financial aid you can receive; your state and college may use it too. SAI can be as low as -1,500, and it no longer considers whether you have siblings in college in the calculation. If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}
{"prompt": "mistake of parent's initials", "completions": "You can make corrections after you've received a FAFSA Submission Summary. Corrections include fixing incorrect info or adding missing info or signatures.

{"prompt": "what's an orphan", "completions": "An orphan is someone whose biological or adoptive parents are deceased. If at any time since turning 13 you have had no living biological or adoptive parents you will be considered independent on the FAFSA. No parent information will be required. If asked, you may need documentation like a death certification to show college(s)."}
{"prompt": "What should I indicate when logging in student or parent", "completions": "If you are a student filling out the FAFSA, select that you are a student. Selecting your role (whether you are a student or parent) at the beginning of the form helps determine what questions the FAFSA asks you."}
{"prompt": "how does my parent reset their username or password", "completions": "Your parent can use their email or phone number as their username instead. To reset their password, they can select \"Forgot my Password.\" If they're having trouble resetting their password, finding their username, or unlocking their account, they can complete the account recovery process at https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/help/recover-account or by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-433-3243."}
{"prompt": "what's a rollover for a retirement plan", "completions": "A rollover is when money or assets are transferred from one retirement plan and contributed to another. If an IRA or pension distribution is a rollover, on your 2022 1040 tax form it should say \"Rollover\" to the left of lines 4b or 5b. If you see a rollover on the tax form, you should report the amount on the FAFSA. If both of these lines are blank on your tax form, you should report 0 for both questions about rollovers. "}
{"prompt": "i do not know what it is", "completions": "The Free Application for Federal Student Aid assesses eligibility for federal grants, federal loans, work-study, and additional aid from colleges. The Federal Student Aid office in the US Department of Education runs the FAFSA. The form is free to fill out. Go to https://fafsa.gov to get started with your application online. If you need a paper copy of the FAFSA it is available in English and Spanish at https://studentaid.gov/forms-library/."}
{"prompt": "My student aid index is a negative number. What does that mean for me", "completions": "The Student Aid Index (SAI) determines your eligibility for federal financial aid. States and colleges can use it to determine your eligibility for their financial aid as well. A negative SAI informs colleges that you have significant financial need and will be eligible for a full Federal Pell Grant."}
{"prompt": "what docs i need", "completions": "To start the FAFSA, you will need your FSA ID and some documents like 2022 tax returns and bank account info. If you need to include parent info on the FAFSA, you'll also need to collect some information from them. Here is a checklist to help you get started https://www.uaspire.org/FAFSA. Pro tip: If you and your parent(s) consent, the IRS will automatically share income and tax info with the FAFSA, reducing the number of questions you must answer."}
{"prompt": "Why isn't child support income", "completions": "Child support received is included in the asset section of the FAFSA. This means it has less impact on your student aid index than if included in the income section. You should only report the total amount received for the last full calendar year."}

{"prompt": "family size is different than my parents taxes", "completions": "Family size should be updated if the number of people claimed on the 2022 taxes is different than the number currently in the household. If you are dependent, it is based on your parent(s) taxes. If you are independent, it is based on your taxes. To see who is claimed on the tax forms, count the tax filer, spouse (if applicable), and anyone in the dependent section. Here's a picture that shows where to look.\n\nIf you're unsure, update it on the FAFSA."}
{"prompt": "why am I inviting my parent", "completions": "Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section. Because the FAFSA has switched to role-based completion, each contributor needs to be invited to your FAFSA. This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}
{"prompt": "I got a grant last year but not this. How come", "completions": "Financial aid can change yearly depending on the info you report on your financial aid forms, your college's financial aid practices, your grades and attendance, and other factors. For example, if your income from 2022 is lower than 2021, your SAI may decrease, meaning you may be eligible for more financial aid than last year. If you're offered less financial aid on your award letter than last year, talk to your college to understand why."}
{"prompt": "My mom passed some years ago I really needs help with this form", "completions": "I'm really sorry to hear that. If one parent has passed away, you should only report the info for your living parent. If your only living parent is a stepparent, you should only invite them to your FAFSA if they have legally adopted you. If your biological or adoptive parents are deceased, you may apply as an independent student. Contact your financial aid offices to confirm what information you need to provide."}
{"prompt": "how is the sai different than the efc", "completions": "Student Aid Index (SAI) has replaced Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as the number the FAFSA calculates. SAI is very similar to EFC and will determine what federal financial aid you can receive; your state and college may use it too. SAI can be as low as -1,500, and it no longer considers whether you have siblings in college in the calculation.

{"prompt": "Is existing form for people who started and are coming back to finish", "completions": "If you haven't started the FAFSA yet, click 'Start a new form.' If you are returning to complete the FAFSA, click 'access existing form.' Either button will take you to the right place to start or continue your FAFSA."}
{"prompt": "Can my parent(s) see my FAFSA submission summary", "completions": "The FAFSA Submission Summary and Student Aid Index (SAI) can only be viewed by you (the student) after your FAFSA processes. The FAFSA should only take a couple of days to process. Your parent(s) can only see the FAFSA Submission Summary or your SAI if you share the information with them. The best way to share this information is by printing it using the link on the top right of the page."}
{"prompt": "Are there online resources to help me navigate different tax schedules", "completions": "Tax schedules are forms the IRS requires people to file if they have specific types of income, claim certain deductions, or other reasons. Reviewing the full tax packet is the best way to see if a schedule was filed. The type of schedule is listed in the top left corner of the form. To find out more information about different schedules, look here: https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/schedules-for-form-1040."}
{"prompt": "What is Temproary Assistance for Needy Families", "completions": "Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) provides financial support to low-income families with children.

If you are a dependent student, you should talk to your parent(s) to determine if your family receives this federal benefit."}
{"prompt": "Why does the FAFSA inquire about my guardians' stock holdings", "completions": "The FAFSA uses income and assets to assess your and your family's ability to pay for college. It is used to calculate your Student Aid Index, which will determine your eligibility for federal financial aid. Your responses to the asset questions won't impact your aid eligibility if your parents' income or federal benefits exempt you from reporting assets."}
{"prompt": "If I'm pregnant am I an independent student", "completions": "Being pregnant does not automatically make you independent on the FAFSA. If you are not independent for other reasons, you must provide parent information on the FAFSA. After submitting the FAFSA, we recommend you contact your college(s) to see if they'll consider a financial aid appeal to consider your pregnancy when determining your financial aid."}
{"prompt": "Why does my parent have to enter financial information manually", "completions": "If you provided consent on the FAFSA but still need to answer tax questions, it could be for a few different reasons. Two common examples are your FSA ID was just created and needs to be verified, or you filed married filing jointly in 2022 but now file differently. As long as you provided consent, having to answer income and tax questions is not a cause for concern."}
{"prompt": "can i complete the fafsa before i submit my college applications", "completions": "You can submit the FAFSA before you apply to college. In the 'Colleges' section, enter the colleges you want to apply to. Later, once you've finished your college applications, return to the FAFSA, update this list, and submit the FAFSA again."}
{"prompt": "what's a student aid index", "completions": "The student aid index (SAI) is a number based on the info submitted on the FAFSA. It determines your eligibility for federal financial aid (like the Pell Grant). If the confirmation email says your SAI can't be calculated or your FAFSA Submission Summary doesn't list one, you'll need to check for errors and make a correction (ex: provide a missing signature) and resubmit. Your SAI is in the 'Eligibility Overview' section on the FAFSA Submission Summary."}
{"prompt": "What if a college asks to see proof of ID", "completions": "A college may ask for a passport or driver's license to prove your identity or confirm your citizenship as part of the verification process. If colleges ask you to show up in person with these documents and you are unable to, you can ask if they'll accept a notarized signed statement and copies of any documents. Never send colleges original copies of any documents."}
{"prompt": "The FAFSA is asking about QHP and i'm not sure what that is", "completions": "A refundable credit for coverage under a Qualified Health Plan (QHP) is received when an individual or family purchases health insurance through their state health insurance exchange and has income that meets the requirements to receive a tax credit. If you are a dependent student, you should talk to your parent(s) to determine if your family receives this federal benefit."}
{"prompt": "i'm having issues with my account. it's locked", "completions": "If your account is locked, go to https://fafsa.gov and attempt to log in.

{"prompt": "do i count my girlfriend as part of my household if i'm an independent", "completions": "If you are dependent, family size includes you, your parent(s), siblings living at home or away at college and being supported by your parent(s), and anyone else that lives with and receives more than half their support from your parent(s). If you are independent, family size includes you, your spouse (if married), and any children or dependents. Family size should be updated on the FAFSA if it differs from the number of people claimed on the 2022 taxes."}
{"prompt": "state financial aid app", "completions": "I only answer questions about the FAFSA. Some states use info from your FAFSA to determine your eligibility for state aid and will receive that information once your FAFSA processes. Other states may require you to fill out a separate application to receive state financial aid. Check to see what your state requires."}
{"prompt": "how do i submit the fafsa on a green card", "completions": "If you're an eligible noncitizen, you can receive federal student aid.

{"prompt": "I need to report net worth", "completions": "Net worth is the value of an asset minus any debt you own on that asset. To determine the net worth of a business, farm, or real estate (like a vacation home or rental property), you would take the value you could sell it for and subtract any debt. If you rent out a part of the home you live in, you only report the net worth of that part. We recommend talking to an accountant if you have questions."}

{"prompt": "do colleges get my SAI too", "completions": "Student Aid Index (SAI) has replaced Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as the number the FAFSA calculates.

If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}
{"prompt": "if only one of my parents work what do i put for the part that asks about how much they each make from working", "completions": "Income earned from work includes money made from working a job, business income, farm income, and other sources.

{"prompt": "how do I add more colleges after the 20 originals", "completions": "To add a college to your list, you can search for it by state, city and/or name.

{"prompt": "i'm in foster care. do i need to get my parents to get an fsa id", "completions": "Foster care is when a state agency places someone in a temporary home, group home, or other resident care facility.

If this doesn't work, a parent can start the FAFSA and then invite you (if you already started the FAFSA make sure to delete it first)."}
{"prompt": "what is the ddx", "completions": "The Direct Data Exchange (DDX) has replaced the IRS DRT as the way to get your federal tax information (FTI) onto your FAFSA.

This process is automatically completed once you consent to the DDX on the FAFSA."}
{"prompt": "why did the fafsa switch to roles", "completions": "Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section. Because the FAFSA has switched to role-based completion, each contributor needs to be invited to your FAFSA. This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}
{"prompt": "how to edit colleges", "completions": "You can add colleges once you receive your FAFSA Submission Summary.
