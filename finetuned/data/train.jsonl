If there are no investments, enter 0s and move on."}
{"text": "Q: Why would I report a scholarship on taxes\nA: You would only have a scholarship reported on your taxes if you or someone in your household was in college in 2022 and received a scholarship that was considered taxable income. Taxable scholarships can appear in two places on the 2022 1040 tax form. Look for \"SCH\" with a dollar amount to the left of line 1a on the 1040 or line 8r on Schedule 1 (if you have one). If you see a number greater than 0 in either place, you should report it on the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: i've been admitted to a college but i don't know how to add the into my fafsa\nA: To add a college to your list, you can search for it by state, city and/or name.

{"text": "Q: when it asks if i have a lived in georgia for 5 years does it still count if i lived here for 1 year then moved to texas and came back after a year and stayed here since then\nA: Your state of legal residence is where your permanent home is. If you go to school in a state different from your home state, be sure to list the home state, not the state you attend school in. If you live separately from your parent(s) for another reason, list your home address. \n\nFor the date of residence, you should list the month and year that you moved to the state. If you were born in that state, you should list the month and year you were born."}
{"text": "Q: What tax schedules did my parents fill out\nA: Tax schedules are forms the IRS requires people to file if they have specific types of income, claim certain deductions, or other reasons.

Follow the guidance here: https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/parent-info#unwilling-parents"}
{"text": "Q: does my mom need an fsa id\nA: If you are applying as a dependent, you and your parent(s) will need separate FSA IDs to complete your respective section.

{"text": "Q: why do I need to do knowledge questions\nA: For people without an SSN, knowledge-based verification questions are required to further prove identity. The questions are different for each person but some examples include asking you to select the street you lived on or a previous employer. You have one chance to answer them correctly or you'll need to provide documentation. Either way you'll be able to use your FSA ID immediately to access the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: Does the aid that I got from the FAFSA last year count as income\nA: You should NOT report the financial aid you received last year as income on your FAFSA. If it is included in your adjusted gross income (AGI), you should report the scholarship amount included in the 'Amount of College Grants, Scholarships, or Americorp Benefits Reported as Income to the IRS' question. Reporting it on the FAFSA ensures it won't impact the financial aid you can receive for next year."}

Colleges will follow up for additional information like court documents or other information."}
{"text": "Q: Can you tell me if my colleges received my FAFSA\nA: Your FAFSA will be processed soon, but it may take colleges longer to receive your information. Each college has its own process for accessing and using FAFSA information. If the college is listed on the 'School Information' tab, they can access your information when needed.

{"text": "Q: is it possible that i get less money this year\nA: Financial aid can change yearly depending on the info you report on your financial aid forms, your college's financial aid practices, your grades and attendance, and other factors. For example, if your income from 2022 is lower than 2021, your SAI may decrease, meaning you may be eligible for more financial aid than last year.

{"text": "Q: Even after consenting, I am required to answer tax questions.

As long as you provided consent, having to answer income and tax questions is not a cause for concern."}

Later, once you've finished your college applications, return to the FAFSA, update this list, and submit the FAFSA again."}

{"text": "Q: Where did the expected family contribution go\nA: Student Aid Index (SAI) has replaced Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as the number the FAFSA calculates. SAI is very similar to EFC and will determine what federal financial aid you can receive; your state and college may use it too. SAI can be as low as -1,500, and it no longer considers whether you have siblings in college in the calculation. If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}
{"text": "Q: should i count my mom as in college if she'll be enrolled\nA: The number in college should include you and your siblings and anyone else in your parent's household who will attend college in 2024-25 more than half-time. Do not count them if they'll attend a U.S. Service Academy. Do NOT count your parent(s). The number you report for this question will not change your federal financial aid eligibility. However, colleges may use it to help determine the institutional aid they can offer you."}
{"text": "Q: how will renewall affect my financial aid\nA: Financial aid can change yearly depending on the info you report on your financial aid forms, your college's financial aid practices, your grades and attendance, and other factors.

{"text": "Q: The FAFSA didn't ask me asset questions. Is this normal\nA: You might not see any or only see very few financial questions on the FAFSA. Due to the new consent process, the IRS shares most income and tax information directly with the FAFSA, so you don't need to answer the questions. In addition, if you receive federal benefits or your income is below a certain amount, the FAFSA will automatically skip any questions about your assets."}
{"text": "Q: Is there a deadline for submitting verification paperwork to colleges\nA: The types of forms you need to fill out for verification will vary based on what information the college is asking for. You may need to provide income information, a list of those included in your family size, or even proof of citizenship.

{"text": "Q: can I use an attestation form\nA: To verify your identity after creating an FSA ID without an SSN, FSA will email you a case number.

Always check to make sure the college has the correct housing status for you. "}

Your responses to the asset questions won't impact your aid eligibility if your parents' income or federal benefits exempt you from reporting assets."}
{"text": "Q: my parent does not have a social security number\nA: You should only create an FSA ID without an SSN if you're the parent or spouse of a student applying for financial aid OR a citizen of the freely associated states.

These programs usually have different names in different states but may be referred to as housing vouchers or section 8. It could also be received if living in public housing. If you are a dependent student, you should talk to your parent(s) to determine if your family receives this federal benefit."}
{"text": "Q: My fafsa didn't ask any tax questions. Did I do something wrong\nA: You might not see any or only see very few financial questions on the FAFSA. Due to the new consent process, the IRS shares most income and tax information directly with the FAFSA, so you don't need to answer the questions. In addition, if you receive federal benefits or your income is below a certain amount, the FAFSA will automatically skip any questions about your assets."}
{"text": "Q: I'm unsure if I have a qualified health plan, can you help me check\nA: A refundable credit for coverage under a Qualified Health Plan (QHP) is received when an individual or family purchases health insurance through their state health insurance exchange and has income that meets the requirements to receive a tax credit. If you are a dependent student, you should talk to your parent(s) to determine if your family receives this federal benefit."}
{"text": "Q: What documents Are required to verify my identity if I have a permanent resident card\nA: To verify your identity after creating an FSA ID without an SSN, FSA will email you a case number.

{"text": "Q: Who will the FAFSA know about my income\nA: If you filed 2022 taxes, the IRS will share specific lines from the tax form, like adjusted gross income, income tax paid, and several others.

Either way, you and any other contributors should provide consent for the IRS to share federal tax information with your FAFSA. Consenting will ensure you are eligible for federal financial aid."}

This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}

If you rent out a part of the home you live in, you only report the net worth of that part. We recommend talking to an accountant if you have questions."}
{"text": "Q: What am I consenting to\nA: Consent is when you give permission for the IRS to share your federal tax information with the FAFSA.

If you're offered less financial aid on your award letter than last year, talk to your college to understand why."}
{"text": "Q: Do my parents have access to my submission summary\nA: The FAFSA Submission Summary and Student Aid Index (SAI) can only be viewed by you (the student) after your FAFSA processes.

{"text": "Q: how do i find net worth\nA: Net worth is the value of an asset minus any debt you own on that asset. To determine the net worth of a business, farm, or real estate (like a vacation home or rental property), you would take the value you could sell it for and subtract any debt.

{"text": "Q: how can i compare my EFC and SAI to make sure i get the money i need\nA: Student Aid Index (SAI) has replaced Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as the number the FAFSA calculates. SAI is very similar to EFC and will determine what federal financial aid you can receive; your state and college may use it too. SAI can be as low as -1,500, and it no longer considers whether you have siblings in college in the calculation. If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}

{"text": "Q: my parents are refusing to help me\nA: If you can, you should encourage your parents to provide their information so you can be considered for as many sources of aid as possible! Your parents won't be required to pay for your college, and it doesn't put them at any risk.\n\nIf they refuse, you may only be able to apply for a direct unsubsidized loan.

{"text": "Q: I can't get information from my parents\nA: If you can, you should encourage your parents to provide their information so you can be considered for as many sources of aid as possible!

{"text": "Q: I'm concerned because my SAI looks nothing like my EFC\nA: Student Aid Index (SAI) has replaced Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as the number the FAFSA calculates. SAI is very similar to EFC and will determine what federal financial aid you can receive; your state and college may use it too. SAI can be as low as -1,500, and it no longer considers whether you have siblings in college in the calculation. If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}
{"text": "Q: How do I know who financially supports me\nA: Financial support can include many things. To determine which parent provides more financial support, you should consider who pays for your housing, food, clothes, and any other expenses you have.

{"text": "Q: i don't have some irs forms\nA: If you need a copy of your W-2, check with your employer. If you need help finding tax forms, check with the service that filed your return.

{"text": "Q: What do I do if my parent didn't file taxes\nA: If you or any other required contributors (parent(s) or spouse) do not plan to file taxes, consent is still required on the FAFSA to be eligible for federal financial aid.

{"text": "Q: what changed to make me have to invite my parent\nA: Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section. Because the FAFSA has switched to role-based completion, each contributor needs to be invited to your FAFSA. This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}
{"text": "Q: I am torn between listing one parent on the form even though they both contribute equally\nA: If both biological or adoptive parents provide equal financial support and their total income and assets are equivalent, but only one needs to be reported on the FAFSA, you can list either parent on the form.

{"text": "Q: how does my mom determine the net worth of her business\nA: Net worth is the value of an asset minus any debt you own on that asset.

If you rent out a part of the home you live in, you only report the net worth of that part. We recommend talking to an accountant if you have questions."}
{"text": "Q: what's the purpose of splitting out different roles on the fafsa\nA: Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section.

This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}

{"text": "Q: Do I put my home or school address\nA: You should use an address where you can receive mail throughout the year.

Always check to make sure the college has the correct housing status for you. "}

{"text": "Q: Consenting on the tax form didn't exempt me from answering tax questions. Why\nA: If you provided consent on the FAFSA but still need to answer tax questions, it could be for a few different reasons.

As long as you provided consent, having to answer income and tax questions is not a cause for concern."}

Each college has its own process for accessing and using FAFSA information. If the college is listed on the 'School Information' tab, they can access your information when needed. If you want to confirm they've received it, wait until you've received a FAFSA Submission Summary before calling."}
{"text": "Q: i have questions for you about DACA\nA: If you have DACA status, you are not eligible for federal financial aid. Whether or not you should complete the FAFSA depends on your state and the colleges you apply to. Check with your state if you are eligible for state financial aid and what you need to do to receive it. Check with your colleges to see how they want you to apply for their financial aid."}
{"text": "Q: fafsa incomplete\nA: Tell me more about what you're having trouble with. You can say things like \"I lost my FSA ID\" or \"I don't know who to put down as my parent.\""}
{"text": "Q: i have a guardian do i have to put their info in fafsa\nA: Legal guardianship is when someone other than your parents is appointed your guardian. If you are under legal guardianship, you should have a court document that shows this decision. No parent or legal guardian information will be required when completing the FAFSA, and you'll be considered an independent student. If asked, you may need a copy of court documents to show your college(s)."}
{"text": "Q: how will i know if this is confidential\nA: Your information will remain completely confidential. I will not share your personal info, including financial information, with any third party. This includes all information that you share with me over text.

{"text": "Q: does filing the FAFSA means I will be in debt\nA: Filling out the FAFSA does NOT automatically put you in debt unless you choose to take out a loan. You are NOT required to take out any loans that you are offered."}
{"text": "Q: why do I have to renew\nA: FAFSA renewal is the process of resubmitting your FAFSA each year you plan to attend college, which is a crucial step to accessing financial aid. To renew your FAFSA, go to https://fafsa.gov, log in with your FSA ID, and start the 24-25 FAFSA. You may notice the FAFSA looks different from last year, and some questions have changed. Don't worry! These changes are due to updates Federal Student Aid is making to improve the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: Spouse didn't do their part of FAFSA\nA: To sign the FAFSA, you need to complete your section. Once you agree to terms, you can click 'sign'. The last contributor to complete their section will see the option to 'sign & submit.' It cannot be submitted until contributors complete their section. Your form will only stay in the system for 45 days if inactive and not submitted. If completing a paper FAFSA, both you and your contributor(s) will need to sign the form and mail it to the address listed."}
{"text": "Q: who counts for my family size number\nA: If you are dependent, family size includes you, your parent(s), siblings living at home or away at college and being supported by your parent(s), and anyone else that lives with and receives more than half their support from your parent(s). If you are independent, family size includes you, your spouse (if married), and any children or dependents. Family size should be updated on the FAFSA if it differs from the number of people claimed on the 2022 taxes."}
{"text": "Q: the parent income from work section\nA: Income earned from work includes money made from working a job, business income, farm income, and other sources. You can find it on lines 1z of the 2022 1040 (or 1040-NR) tax form and 3 and 6 of Schedule 1. This question will only show up for tax-filers who need to manually answer income/tax questions. For non-tax filers, income or tax questions won't be asked on the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: can you explain the line of duty question\nA: If your parent was killed in the line of duty as an active member of the armed forces after 9/11/2001 or while working as a public safety officer (police officer, firefighter, or emergency service worker), you may be automatically eligible to receive a full Pell Grant. You will need to talk to your college(s) and provide any requested documentation."}
{"text": "Q: on adding schools\nA: To add a college to your list, you can search for it by state, city and/or name. The FAFSA will tell whether your state requires you to list colleges in a particular order and give you the option to change the order. Colleges can't see the other schools on your FAFSA or the order in which you list them. You can list up to 20 colleges. To add more you should submit the FAFSA and swap out the colleges after receiving the FAFSA Submission Summary."}
{"text": "Q: what should i do after creating the fsa id\nA: If you created an FSA ID with a SSN, it will take 1-3 days to be verified.\n\nIf a parent/contributor created an FSA ID without an SSN and successfully answered the knowledge based identity questions, it can be used immediately.

Contributors can complete the FAFSA with their FSA ID before it is verified, which usually takes 7-14 days."}
{"text": "Q: how do i enter a foreign tax return on fafsa\nA: If you or your parent(s) are a foreign tax filer, earned money in a foreign country but did not file a tax return, or filed a tax return in Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory, income and tax info must be manually provided on the FAFSA. Convert currency amounts to U.S. dollars and do your best to align the information on your tax return to the questions asked. Colleges will ask for additional info to confirm what was entered."}
{"text": "Q: Why am I being prompted for tax details despite giving consent earlier\nA: If you provided consent on the FAFSA but still need to answer tax questions, it could be for a few different reasons. Two common examples are your FSA ID was just created and needs to be verified, or you filed married filing jointly in 2022 but now file differently. As long as you provided consent, having to answer income and tax questions is not a cause for concern."}
{"text": "Q: do i need to report my mom's income if she died\nA: I'm really sorry to hear that. If one parent has passed away, you should only report the info for your living parent. If your only living parent is a stepparent, you should only invite them to your FAFSA if they have legally adopted you. If your biological or adoptive parents are deceased, you may apply as an independent student. Contact your financial aid offices to confirm what information you need to provide."}
{"text": "Q: is there a cost for your services\nA: Hi, I'm Wyatt! I'm a bot here to answer your questions about the FAFSA. I'm powered by Benefits Data Trust, a nonprofit organization.

{"text": "Q: When do I know if I can use my FSA ID\nA: Go to https://studentaid.gov/ and log in. On the right side of the page, under \"My Info\", click on \"Settings\" and then \"Personal Information.\" If you see a green checkmark that says SSA verified, your FSA ID is ready to use."}
{"text": "Q: I'm renewing my fafsa and can't figure out where the signature page is\nA: The signature page is no longer an option for the 2024-25 FAFSA.

Your parent(s) will still need to verify their identify after it processes. The paper FAFSA is available in English and Spanish at https://studentaid.gov/forms-library/."}
{"text": "Q: what should i put for college degree\nA: If you are a high school senior or haven't attended college before, you should select 'First year undergraduate (freshman).'

{"text": "Q: How Do I verify my identity if I am a non-US citizen\nA: To verify your identity after creating an FSA ID without an SSN, FSA will email you a case number.

You can fill out the FAFSA with your FSA ID while your identity is being verified, which usually takes 7-14 days."}
{"text": "Q: can you help me share my summary sheet\nA: The FAFSA Submission Summary and Student Aid Index (SAI) can only be viewed by you (the student) after your FAFSA processes. The FAFSA should only take a couple of days to process. Your parent(s) can only see the FAFSA Submission Summary or your SAI if you share the information with them. The best way to share this information is by printing it using the link on the top right of the page."}
{"text": "Q: My fafsa isn't asking me any income questions. How will it know if I'm eligible\nA: You might not see any or only see very few financial questions on the FAFSA. Due to the new consent process, the IRS shares most income and tax information directly with the FAFSA, so you don't need to answer the questions. In addition, if you receive federal benefits or your income is below a certain amount, the FAFSA will automatically skip any questions about your assets."}
{"text": "Q: help with state aid application\nA: I only answer questions about the FAFSA. Some states use info from your FAFSA to determine your eligibility for state aid and will receive that information once your FAFSA processes. Other states may require you to fill out a separate application to receive state financial aid. Check to see what your state requires."}
{"text": "Q: so it's not guaranteed i will get money\nA: Some students qualify for up to $7,395 in Pell Grants plus other financial aid. You won't know what you're eligible for until you apply. Use this calculator to figure what you are eligible for: https://studentaid.gov/aid-estimator/"}

{"text": "Q: I'm just starting so I selected new form. Is that right\nA: If you haven't started the FAFSA yet, click 'Start a new form.' If you are returning to complete the FAFSA, click 'access existing form.' Either button will take you to the right place to start or continue your FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: Can I share FSA\nA: If you are applying as a dependent, you and your parent(s) will need separate FSA IDs to complete your respective section. The FAFSA will help you identify which parent(s) you must invite to complete the parent section. If you are applying as an independent, only you need to fill out and sign the FAFSA.

{"text": "Q: How can student fill in address in another country\nA: Your state of legal residence is where your permanent home is.

If you live separately from your parent(s) for another reason, list your home address. \n\nFor the date of residence, you should list the month and year that you moved to the state. If you were born in that state, you should list the month and year you were born."}
{"text": "Q: Why Is the school requesting identification from me\nA: A college may ask for a passport or driver's license to prove your identity or confirm your citizenship as part of the verification process. If colleges ask you to show up in person with these documents and you are unable to, you can ask if they'll accept a notarized signed statement and copies of any documents. Never send colleges original copies of any documents."}
{"text": "Q: if i did dual enrollment, do i put attended college before/1st yr\nA: You cannot get financial aid to pay for dual enrollment courses because the FAFSA considers DE a part of high school.

{"text": "Q: I am going to college in 2021, which form should I use\nA: If you're planning to go to college in the fall of 2024, you should fill out the 2024-25 FAFSA by going to https://fafsa.gov. \n\n Do not fill out the 2023-24 FAFSA unless you're currently in college AND haven't filled out a FAFSA for fall 2023 or planning to go to college in the spring of 2024. Fill it out ASAP at https://fafsa.gov."}
{"text": "Q: where is the parent wizard\nA: The parent wizard is a set of questions in the FAFSA that will help you determine which parent(s) you need to invite to complete their section of the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: i forgot my parents username and password\nA: Your parent can use their email or phone number as their username instead. To reset their password, they can select \"Forgot my Password.\" If they're having trouble resetting their password, finding their username, or unlocking their account, they can complete the account recovery process at https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/help/recover-account or by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-433-3243."}
{"text": "Q: what phone # for fsa\nA: A phone number is not required to create an FSA ID. If you have your own mobile phone number, we recommend using it to have it as an option for two-factor authentication and password recovery."}
{"text": "Q: fafsa hours\nA: Creating an FSA ID only takes about 15 minutes. You can get it done even more quickly if you have your social security number and access to your email and phone.\n\nFiling the FAFSA takes about 1 hour to complete.

{"text": "Q: How does having a 529 affect financial aid\nA: If your parent(s) have a 529 plan with you as the beneficiary, they would report it in the parent asset section of the FAFSA. They should not include any other 529 plans they have for your siblings. If a grandparent or someone else besides your parent(s) has a 529 plan for you, do not include it on your FAFSA. \n\n If you are independent on the FAFSA and have your own 529 plan, you must include it as an asset."}
{"text": "Q: Student Aid Index vs Expected Family Contribution\nA: Student Aid Index (SAI) has replaced Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as the number the FAFSA calculates. SAI is very similar to EFC and will determine what federal financial aid you can receive; your state and college may use it too. SAI can be as low as -1,500, and it no longer considers whether you have siblings in college in the calculation. If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}
{"text": "Q: what's adjusted gross income\nA: AGI is Adjusted Gross Income. It is annual income minus some deductions. If you need to provide tax information manually, you should enter line 11 from the 1040. If you haven't already, you should consent to the IRS sharing tax information with the FAFSA to ensure you are eligible for federal financial aid. For the 2024-25 FAFSA, you and your parent(s) must use your 2022 federal tax return."}
{"text": "Q: which form do I pick if I'm renewing\nA: FAFSA renewal is the process of resubmitting your FAFSA each year you plan to attend college, which is a crucial step to accessing financial aid. To renew your FAFSA, go to https://fafsa.gov, log in with your FSA ID, and start the 24-25 FAFSA. You may notice the FAFSA looks different from last year, and some questions have changed. Don't worry! These changes are due to updates Federal Student Aid is making to improve the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: something else\nA: Tell me more about what you're having trouble with. You can say things like \"I lost my FSA ID\" or \"I don't know who to put down as my parent.\""}
{"text": "Q: Does financial aid cover dormitory in school\nA: The FAFSA no longer asks for your housing status for each college you are applying to. Colleges will likely follow up to understand where you will be living while attending their college. It is really important to respond if you receive any requests from the college asking about housing. This will help make your financial aid offers more accurate when you receive them. Always check to make sure the college has the correct housing status for you. "}
{"text": "Q: if i'm an independent who counts as in my household\nA: If you are dependent, family size includes you, your parent(s), siblings living at home or away at college and being supported by your parent(s), and anyone else that lives with and receives more than half their support from your parent(s). If you are independent, family size includes you, your spouse (if married), and any children or dependents. Family size should be updated on the FAFSA if it differs from the number of people claimed on the 2022 taxes."}
{"text": "Q: Is it possible to share my submission summary with my guardians\nA: The FAFSA Submission Summary and Student Aid Index (SAI) can only be viewed by you (the student) after your FAFSA processes. The FAFSA should only take a couple of days to process. Your parent(s) can only see the FAFSA Submission Summary or your SAI if you share the information with them. The best way to share this information is by printing it using the link on the top right of the page."}

{"text": "Q: what is net worth of parents' investment and how would you find out\nA: Net worth is the value of an asset minus any debt you own on that asset. To determine the net worth of a business, farm, or real estate (like a vacation home or rental property), you would take the value you could sell it for and subtract any debt. If you rent out a part of the home you live in, you only report the net worth of that part. We recommend talking to an accountant if you have questions."}

You will need to talk to your college(s) and provide any requested documentation."}
{"text": "Q: Uploaded in the system\nA: If you filed 2022 taxes, the IRS will share specific lines from the tax form, like adjusted gross income, income tax paid, and several others.

{"text": "Q: so i have an account for my father and i have an account for me which account am i supposed to fill the application on mine or my fathers\nA: If you are applying as a dependent, you and your parent(s) will need separate FSA IDs to complete your respective section. The FAFSA will help you identify which parent(s) you must invite to complete the parent section. If you are applying as an independent, only you need to fill out and sign the FAFSA. The FSA ID acts as your legal signature and what you'll use to log into and complete the FAFSA each year. This is a unique ID and cannot be shared.\n\nTo create one, go to https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch"}
{"text": "Q: what is ssa\nA: A social security number (SSN) is a 9-digit number given by the Social Security Administration. You can find it on your social security card. If you can't find it or don't have a social security card, you can also find it on W-2s or tax returns. If you cannot find your SSN, you can apply for a replacement card directly from the Social Security Administration's website: https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber. You cannot use your ITIN as a substitute for your SSN."}
{"text": "Q: What if on my 2022 tax return there is nothing on the amount of college grants, scholarships, or americorp benefits reported as income\nA: You should NOT report the financial aid you received last year as income on your FAFSA. If it is included in your adjusted gross income (AGI), you should report the scholarship amount included in the 'Amount of College Grants, Scholarships, or Americorp Benefits Reported as Income to the IRS' question.

{"text": "Q: my parents missed the tax deadline because of covid\nA: If you or any other required contributors (parent(s) or spouse) do not plan to file taxes, consent is still required on the FAFSA to be eligible for federal financial aid.

{"text": "Q: how do i get through verification\nA: The types of forms you need to fill out for verification will vary based on what information the college is asking for.

As long as you provided consent, having to answer income and tax questions is not a cause for concern."}
{"text": "Q: Can I edit contributor info after my FAFSA is done\nA: If you entered an incorrect name, DOB, or SSN for a contributor, log in to the FAFSA and correct it. If you entered an incorrect email, it's okay as long as the other items match. Once they log in with their FSA ID, they'll see the invite to your FAFSA.\n\nIf your FAFSA was submitted with the wrong contributor, you can fix it once it processes by making a correction.

For example, if your income from 2022 is lower than 2021, your SAI may decrease, meaning you may be eligible for more financial aid than last year. If you're offered less financial aid on your award letter than last year, talk to your college to understand why."}

{"text": "Q: what happens once i invite my parent\nA: Once you invite a contributor (parent or spouse) to complete their section of your FAFSA, they can log in to https://fafsa.gov and accept the contributor invite.

{"text": "Q: Process for adding colleges\nA: To add a college to your list, you can search for it by state, city and/or name.

Colleges can't see the other schools on your FAFSA or the order in which you list them. You can list up to 20 colleges. To add more you should submit the FAFSA and swap out the colleges after receiving the FAFSA Submission Summary."}
{"text": "Q: what's an investment\nA: Investments on the FAFSA include the net worth of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate, trust funds, and more. 529 accounts are reported if you (the student) are the beneficiary and they should be reported in the parent section.

In addition, if you receive federal benefits or your income is below a certain amount, the FAFSA will automatically skip any questions about your assets."}
{"text": "Q: what do i put for the fafsa application for student financials if i am currently working\nA: If you earned some money in 2022 but didn't file taxes, you will NOT need to report it on your FAFSA.

{"text": "Q: my mom hasn't worked\nA: If your parent doesn't work, they must still consent to the IRS sharing their federal tax information (FTI) with the FAFSA.

"}
{"text": "Q: why is my sai so different from my efc\nA: Student Aid Index (SAI) has replaced Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as the number the FAFSA calculates. SAI is very similar to EFC and will determine what federal financial aid you can receive; your state and college may use it too.

If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}

At least one parent must create a separate FSA ID, complete their section(s), and sign the FAFSA. The FAFSA considers your parent(s) to be your legal (biological or adoptive) parent. If you're independent, you do NOT need to involve your parent(s).To determine which parent needs to be invited to your FAFSA, say \"which parent\", and I'll help you figure it out!"}

If asked, you may need a copy of court documents to show college(s)."}

If a Schedule 2 wasn't filed, or there was no amount on line 2, report the amount on line 22 of the 1040."}
{"text": "Q: Is the process of renewing my fafsa the same as last year\nA: FAFSA renewal is the process of resubmitting your FAFSA each year you plan to attend college, which is a crucial step to accessing financial aid. To renew your FAFSA, go to https://fafsa.gov, log in with your FSA ID, and start the 24-25 FAFSA. You may notice the FAFSA looks different from last year, and some questions have changed. Don't worry! These changes are due to updates Federal Student Aid is making to improve the FAFSA."}

{"text": "Q: Where on taxes can I see family size\nA: Family size should be updated if the number of people claimed on the 2022 taxes is different than the number currently in the household.

Here's a picture that shows where to look.\n\nIf you're unsure, update it on the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: I need to submit additional documents for verification\nA: Verification is the process colleges use to confirm the information from your FAFSA.

{"text": "Q: Why Is my college asking for my identification documents\nA: A college may ask for a passport or driver's license to prove your identity or confirm your citizenship as part of the verification process. If colleges ask you to show up in person with these documents and you are unable to, you can ask if they'll accept a notarized signed statement and copies of any documents. Never send colleges original copies of any documents."}
{"text": "Q: Can I send a signature page again\nA: The signature page is no longer an option for the 2024-25 FAFSA. A parent without an SSN can now create an FSA ID and use it to sign the FAFSA. If your parent cannot create an FSA ID, you can complete a paper FAFSA, have your parent(s) sign it, and mail it in. Your parent(s) will still need to verify their identify after it processes.

{"text": "Q: can family contribution change with new aid index\nA: Student Aid Index (SAI) has replaced Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as the number the FAFSA calculates.

If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}

{"text": "Q: Why am I still being asked tax questions\nA: If you provided consent on the FAFSA but still need to answer tax questions, it could be for a few different reasons. Two common examples are your FSA ID was just created and needs to be verified, or you filed married filing jointly in 2022 but now file differently. As long as you provided consent, having to answer income and tax questions is not a cause for concern."}
{"text": "Q: Is it okay for my dad to fill out his section first\nA: Either you or your parent can start the FAFSA. In the beginning, you can select that you are a 'Student,' or if your parent is starting it, they can select they are a 'Parent.'

To add more you should submit the FAFSA and swap out the colleges after receiving the FAFSA Submission Summary."}
{"text": "Q: what do i put for income if only one of my parents files taxes\nA: If you or any other required contributors (parent(s) or spouse) do not plan to file taxes, consent is still required on the FAFSA to be eligible for federal financial aid.

Same with other  questions like Untaxed Portions of IRA Distributions (Line 4a minus 4b) and Untaxed Portions of Pensions (Line 5a minus 5b). I look at their 1040 form and it's blank. I know I am looking at the right section because I am using the website fafsa provided to find this information .  Another question is there some questions that I cannot find in my parents taxes form like Deductible Payments to IRA/Keogh/other (Schedule 1, total of Lines 16 + 20) fafsa tells me where to look for it but my parents don't have that form.  My question is everyone supposed to have a Schedule 1 or 2 or 3 or schedule C or are these just for section people.\nA: Untaxed portions of IRA distributions are the amount of money taken from an IRA that is not taxed for the given tax year. To find this amount, subtract line 4a from 4b on the 2022 1040 tax form. If the number is negative or there are no numbers in boxes 4a and 4b, put 0."}

You won't need your W-2 to report any information. If you did file taxes, the IRS will share your income/tax information directly if you provided your consent when starting the FAFSA.

{"text": "Q: Last time I renewed my fafsa it autofilled my information.

{"text": "Q: Is a direct unsubsidized loan a better choice for me\nA: You should only choose to 'apply for a direct unsubsidized loan only' if you are considered a dependent student, but your parent(s) refuse to provide their information on your FAFSA. If you select this option, you will not be eligible for any other federal financial aid unless your parent(s) provide their information. You should contact your college and explain your parent's refusal to see if they would allow you to apply as an independent student. "}
{"text": "Q: i printed the paper and emailed it\nA: Congrats on submitting the FAFSA! It may take a little while, but once you receive your FAFSA Submission Summary, you'll know it has processed.

If you have, you must complete verification to receive financial aid."}
{"text": "Q: what is role-based completion\nA: Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section.

This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}
{"text": "Q: Where can I find income earned from work\nA: Income earned from work includes money made from working a job, business income, farm income, and other sources.

{"text": "Q: how do i change my family size\nA: Family size should be updated if the number of people claimed on the 2022 taxes is different than the number currently in the household.

{"text": "Q: both my parents passed away so how should i apply for tax return\nA: I'm really sorry to hear that. If one parent has passed away, you should only report the info for your living parent.

{"text": "Q: when my mother tries to put the signature it says that her fsa id isn't matching the information that was inputted\nA: To submit the FAFSA, all contributors need to have completed and signed their sections.

{"text": "Q: how do I renew\nA: FAFSA renewal is the process of resubmitting your FAFSA each year you plan to attend college, which is a crucial step to accessing financial aid. To renew your FAFSA, go to https://fafsa.gov, log in with your FSA ID, and start the 24-25 FAFSA. You may notice the FAFSA looks different from last year, and some questions have changed. Don't worry! These changes are due to updates Federal Student Aid is making to improve the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: I got a negative Student aid index\nA: The Student Aid Index (SAI) determines your eligibility for federal financial aid. States and colleges can use it to determine your eligibility for their financial aid as well.

{"text": "Q: I don\u2019t have room to add all the schools I'm applying to\nA: To add a college to your list, you can search for it by state, city and/or name. The FAFSA will tell whether your state requires you to list colleges in a particular order and give you the option to change the order. Colleges can't see the other schools on your FAFSA or the order in which you list them. You can list up to 20 colleges. To add more you should submit the FAFSA and swap out the colleges after receiving the FAFSA Submission Summary."}

{"text": "Q: can I do my parents section like last year\nA: Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section. Because the FAFSA has switched to role-based completion, each contributor needs to be invited to your FAFSA. This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}
{"text": "Q: do i have to complete the whole journey\nA: Whether or not the FAFSA is required depends on the state you live in. You should check to see if your state requires you to submit the FAFSA to graduate from high school. Even if it isn't required, the FAFSA is the only way to access federal grants, work-study, and loans for college. It only takes 1 hour to complete! The form is free to fill out. Go to https://fafsa.gov to get started with your application."}
{"text": "Q: legal residence state\nA: Your state of legal residence is where your permanent home is.

If you were born in that state, you should list the month and year you were born."}
{"text": "Q: My parents cant access my fafsa form\nA: To invite your parent(s) to your FAFSA, you must provide their name, date of birth, Social Security number (SSN), email address, and mailing address (if no SSN).

{"text": "Q: how is the sai different than the efc\nA: Student Aid Index (SAI) has replaced Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as the number the FAFSA calculates. SAI is very similar to EFC and will determine what federal financial aid you can receive; your state and college may use it too. SAI can be as low as -1,500, and it no longer considers whether you have siblings in college in the calculation. If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}
{"text": "Q: about ged\nA: A high school equivalent is an alternative to a high school diploma your state recognizes, and it usually involves passing a test. Some common high school equivalency tests are the GED, HiSET, and TASC. "}

{"text": "Q: i'm eligible for Pell but wasn't before, did i do something wrong\nA: Financial aid can change yearly depending on the info you report on your financial aid forms, your college's financial aid practices, your grades and attendance, and other factors. For example, if your income from 2022 is lower than 2021, your SAI may decrease, meaning you may be eligible for more financial aid than last year. If you're offered less financial aid on your award letter than last year, talk to your college to understand why."}
{"text": "Q: my mother and i are from puerto rico where is the income tax for my mother\nA: Income tax paid is the amount in federal tax payments for the given tax year. You can find income tax paid on line 22 of the 2022 1040 tax form. On the FAFSA, you must subtract Schedule 2 line 2 from line 22 of the 1040. If a Schedule 2 wasn't filed, or there was no amount on line 2, report the amount on line 22 of the 1040."}
{"text": "Q: i think i'm an emancipated minor\nA: Emancipation is a legal process that allows someone under 18 to no longer be under the custody of their parent(s). If you are or have been an emancipated minor at any time since turning 13, you won't need to provide parent information and will be considered independent on the FAFSA. If asked, you may need a copy of court documents to show college(s)."}
{"text": "Q: Is there a way for my parents to view my student aid information\nA: The FAFSA Submission Summary and Student Aid Index (SAI) can only be viewed by you (the student) after your FAFSA processes. The FAFSA should only take a couple of days to process. Your parent(s) can only see the FAFSA Submission Summary or your SAI if you share the information with them. The best way to share this information is by printing it using the link on the top right of the page."}
{"text": "Q: my FSA ID for parents\nA: If you are applying as a dependent, you and your parent(s) will need separate FSA IDs to complete your respective section. The FAFSA will help you identify which parent(s) you must invite to complete the parent section. If you are applying as an independent, only you need to fill out and sign the FAFSA. The FSA ID acts as your legal signature and what you'll use to log into and complete the FAFSA each year. This is a unique ID and cannot be shared.\n\nTo create one, go to https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch"}
{"text": "Q: Have you received confirmation that my consent was processed\nA: As long as you click the 'approve' button on the consent page of your FAFSA, you should be all set. The FAFSA won't tell you what information was shared, but after submitting, you should review the FAFSA submission summary to ensure everything was processed correctly."}
{"text": "Q: my parents don't have a tax return\nA: If you or any other required contributors (parent(s) or spouse) do not plan to file taxes, consent is still required on the FAFSA to be eligible for federal financial aid. If taxes won't be filed income will NOT need to be reported on the FAFSA. However, you'll need to answer a question about why taxes weren't filed.\n\n If you still need to file your tax return you should still consent to the IRS sharing your federal tax info and complete the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb by any chance do you know if the como app.org is having any problems\nA: Applying to college and filling out the FAFSA are different. College applications determine if you will be accepted into a college or university. The FAFSA assesses your eligibility for federal aid to help pay for college. Once you file the FAFSA, you'll need to apply to the colleges you have chosen if you haven't already. If you indicated on the Common App that you are interested in 'need-based aid,' then you should definitely fill out the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: last year I didn't need to invite my parents. I could just do the whole thing myself with their info\nA: Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section. Because the FAFSA has switched to role-based completion, each contributor needs to be invited to your FAFSA. This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}
{"text": "Q: my fasfa keeps saying action required\nA: To sign the FAFSA, you need to complete your section. Once you agree to terms, you can click 'sign'. The last contributor to complete their section will see the option to 'sign & submit.' It cannot be submitted until contributors complete their section. Your form will only stay in the system for 45 days if inactive and not submitted. If completing a paper FAFSA, both you and your contributor(s) will need to sign the form and mail it to the address listed."}
{"text": "Q: where is the sar\nA: The FAFSA Submission Summary has replaced the Student Aid Report (SAR) as the summary of the information you put on the FAFSA.

You won't need your W-2 to report any information. If you did file taxes, the IRS will share your income/tax information directly if you provided your consent when starting the FAFSA.

{"text": "Q: will the new fafsa effect how much money I could get\nA: Financial aid can change yearly depending on the info you report on your financial aid forms, your college's financial aid practices, your grades and attendance, and other factors.

You should select the answer that best represents your parent(s) education level and choose 'Don't know' if you are unsure. "}
{"text": "Q: how come each contributor needs to be invited this year\nA: Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section. Because the FAFSA has switched to role-based completion, each contributor needs to be invited to your FAFSA. This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}
{"text": "Q: I'm unsure if my insurance plan counts as a QHP for this application\nA: A refundable credit for coverage under a Qualified Health Plan (QHP) is received when an individual or family purchases health insurance through their state health insurance exchange and has income that meets the requirements to receive a tax credit.

This process is automatically completed once you consent to the DDX on the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: benefits like medicaid\nA: To determine what federal benefits your family received, you should talk through the list with them.

{"text": "Q: im not sure how much income i made\nA: If you earned some money in 2022 but didn't file taxes, you will NOT need to report it on your FAFSA. You won't need your W-2 to report any information. If you did file taxes, the IRS will share your income/tax information directly if you provided your consent when starting the FAFSA. Whether you filed taxes or not, you should consent so the IRS can share your information with the FAFSA. This consent is mandatory to qualify for federal financial aid."}
{"text": "Q: income tax for 2018\nA: Income tax paid is the amount in federal tax payments for the given tax year. You can find income tax paid on line 22 of the 2022 1040 tax form.

If there is an amount greater than 0 on line 27, an EIC was received, and you should say 'Yes' if asked on the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: i don't know which of my parents to list because they both support me financially\nA: If you're an eligible noncitizen, you can receive federal student aid.

The FAFSA sends a reminder every 7 days, but you should tell them that you can only submit once they complete their section of the FAFSA. "}
{"text": "Q: why do i invite my parent\nA: Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section.

This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}
{"text": "Q: My wife and I filed taxes together, do we both need FSA IDs\nA: If you and your spouse filed 2022 taxes as Married filing jointly only you will need an FSA ID. If you and your spouse did not file taxes in 2022 or filed taxes separately, both of you will need an FSA ID.\n\nFSA IDs cannot be shared.

They should try logging in even if they didn't get an email invite. If they haven't received an invite, verify the info you provided to invite them is accurate. If this doesn't work, a parent can start the FAFSA and then invite you (if you already started the FAFSA make sure to delete it first)."}

The FAFSA will only ask questions that are relevant to you based on your responses."}
{"text": "Q: My parents made an account however my mom's account somehow got unverified\nA: To verify your identity after creating an FSA ID without an SSN, FSA will email you a case number.

You can fill out the FAFSA with your FSA ID while your identity is being verified, which usually takes 7-14 days."}
{"text": "Q: my spuse doesn't have an email\nA: An email address is required to create an FSA ID. If you don't have one, you can create a free one via Google or Yahoo. Make sure to use an email address you'll have access to throughout college.

Pro tip: If you and your parent(s) consent, the IRS will automatically share income and tax info with the FAFSA, reducing the number of questions you must answer."}
{"text": "Q: why did i get less money this year\nA: Financial aid can change yearly depending on the info you report on your financial aid forms, your college's financial aid practices, your grades and attendance, and other factors. For example, if your income from 2022 is lower than 2021, your SAI may decrease, meaning you may be eligible for more financial aid than last year. If you're offered less financial aid on your award letter than last year, talk to your college to understand why."}

{"text": "Q: do i have to wait after i first create an account\nA: If you created an FSA ID with a SSN, it will take 1-3 days to be verified.\n\nIf a parent/contributor created an FSA ID without an SSN and successfully answered the knowledge based identity questions, it can be used immediately.

{"text": "Q: where is my FAFSA info\nA: To see your answers on the FAFSA, you will need to go to the 'FAFSA Form Answers' tab in your FAFSA Submission Summary, which you'll receive after your FAFSA processes.

You can only see manually answered income/tax questions."}
{"text": "Q: Do I have to consent if I didn't file taxes\nA: Anyone filling out a section of your FAFSA must consent for you to be eligible for federal financial aid.

{"text": "Q: what do i do if my parents didn't file taxes\nA: If you or any other required contributors (parent(s) or spouse) do not plan to file taxes, consent is still required on the FAFSA to be eligible for federal financial aid.

However, you'll need to answer a question about why taxes weren't filed.\n\n If you still need to file your tax return you should still consent to the IRS sharing your federal tax info and complete the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: why did the fafsa switch to roles\nA: Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section. Because the FAFSA has switched to role-based completion, each contributor needs to be invited to your FAFSA. This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}
{"text": "Q: real help\nA: If you'd like further help with your FAFSA, you can chat with a live person at https://studentaid.gov/help-center/contact\n\nOr if you'd like to speak with someone on the phone, you can call the FAFSA\u00ae helpline at 1-800-433-3243. If you are unable to get through on the phone you should try to email or live chat."}
{"text": "Q: Why do I have to deal with tax inquiries after already consenting\nA: If you provided consent on the FAFSA but still need to answer tax questions, it could be for a few different reasons. Two common examples are your FSA ID was just created and needs to be verified, or you filed married filing jointly in 2022 but now file differently. As long as you provided consent, having to answer income and tax questions is not a cause for concern."}
{"text": "Q: my parents don't want to help with my fafsa, but i dont count as unusual circumstance. what should i do\nA: If you can, you should encourage your parents to provide their information so you can be considered for as many sources of aid as possible!

{"text": "Q: what is the student aid index\nA: The student aid index (SAI) is a number based on the info submitted on the FAFSA. It determines your eligibility for federal financial aid (like the Pell Grant). If the confirmation email says your SAI can't be calculated or your FAFSA Submission Summary doesn't list one, you'll need to check for errors and make a correction (ex: provide a missing signature) and resubmit. Your SAI is in the 'Eligibility Overview' section on the FAFSA Submission Summary."}
{"text": "Q: is this after i've been accepted\nA: You can submit the FAFSA before you apply to college. In the 'Colleges' section, enter the colleges you want to apply to. Later, once you've finished your college applications, return to the FAFSA, update this list, and submit the FAFSA again."}
{"text": "Q: what is considered debt\nA: Filling out the FAFSA does NOT automatically put you in debt unless you choose to take out a loan. You are NOT required to take out any loans that you are offered."}
{"text": "Q: what to do if my fasfa say Errors Found in Your Application\nA: To submit the FAFSA, all contributors need to have completed and signed their sections. If you still need a contributor (parent or spouse) to complete their section, ensure their information (name, date of birth, SSN, and email) is correct. The FAFSA sends a reminder every 7 days, but you should tell them that you can only submit once they complete their section of the FAFSA. "}
{"text": "Q: Does the FAFSA change mean I'll get more money\nA: The FAFSA has undergone changes required by federal legislation to simplify and reduce the questions, making it better for students and families.

Colleges can't see the other schools on your FAFSA or the order in which you list them. You can list up to 20 colleges. To add more you should submit the FAFSA and swap out the colleges after receiving the FAFSA Submission Summary."}
{"text": "Q: I'm pregnant, how does that affect my FAFSA\nA: Being pregnant does not automatically make you independent on the FAFSA.

After submitting the FAFSA, we recommend you contact your college(s) to see if they'll consider a financial aid appeal to consider your pregnancy when determining your financial aid."}
{"text": "Q: what grade level for dual enrollment\nA: You cannot get financial aid to pay for dual enrollment courses because the FAFSA considers DE a part of high school.

{"text": "Q: what should i do if my ssn is missing\nA: A social security number (SSN) is a 9-digit number given by the Social Security Administration. You can find it on your social security card.

How do I fill out the FAFSA\nA: If your parent was killed in the line of duty as an active member of the armed forces after 9/11/2001 or while working as a public safety officer (police officer, firefighter, or emergency service worker), you may be automatically eligible to receive a full Pell Grant.

To see who is claimed on the tax forms, count the tax filer, spouse (if applicable), and anyone in the dependent section. Here's a picture that shows where to look.\n\nIf you're unsure, update it on the FAFSA."}

{"text": "Q: My dad was laid off last month, but I already submitted my FAFSA. What do I do\nA: If your or your family's income or financial situation has changed recently, still provide consent to using your 2022 tax information. Submit your FAFSA with the financial info that you have. Then, contact your colleges' financial aid offices to explain your situation and request they reevaluate your application. Don't worry; this process is normal."}
{"text": "Q: my mom passed away this year\nA: I'm really sorry to hear that. If one parent has passed away, you should only report the info for your living parent. If your only living parent is a stepparent, you should only invite them to your FAFSA if they have legally adopted you. If your biological or adoptive parents are deceased, you may apply as an independent student. Contact your financial aid offices to confirm what information you need to provide."}

The FAFSA will help you identify which parent(s) you must invite to complete the parent section. If you are applying as an independent, only you need to fill out and sign the FAFSA. The FSA ID acts as your legal signature and what you'll use to log into and complete the FAFSA each year. This is a unique ID and cannot be shared.\n\nTo create one, go to https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch"}
{"text": "Q: I need help signing\nA: To sign the FAFSA, you need to complete your section. Once you agree to terms, you can click 'sign'.

{"text": "Q: How do I determine which federal benefits my family has\nA: To determine what federal benefits your family received, you should talk through the list with them.

{"text": "Q: I receive email but it won't give me an SAI after i submitted.\nA: The student aid index (SAI) is a number based on the info submitted on the FAFSA. It determines your eligibility for federal financial aid (like the Pell Grant). If the confirmation email says your SAI can't be calculated or your FAFSA Submission Summary doesn't list one, you'll need to check for errors and make a correction (ex: provide a missing signature) and resubmit. Your SAI is in the 'Eligibility Overview' section on the FAFSA Submission Summary."}
{"text": "Q: Will i still be able to go to college if I'm pregnant\nA: Being pregnant does not automatically make you independent on the FAFSA. If you are not independent for other reasons, you must provide parent information on the FAFSA. After submitting the FAFSA, we recommend you contact your college(s) to see if they'll consider a financial aid appeal to consider your pregnancy when determining your financial aid."}
{"text": "Q: is a w2 tax form a 1040 tax form\nA: If you earned some money in 2022 but didn't file taxes, you will NOT need to report it on your FAFSA. You won't need your W-2 to report any information. If you did file taxes, the IRS will share your income/tax information directly if you provided your consent when starting the FAFSA.

{"text": "Q: can I print out a signature page\nA: The signature page is no longer an option for the 2024-25 FAFSA. A parent without an SSN can now create an FSA ID and use it to sign the FAFSA.

{"text": "Q: So do you help me fill out college applications as well\nA: Applying to college and filling out the FAFSA are different.

{"text": "Q: Define financial support\nA: Financial support can include many things. To determine which parent provides more financial support, you should consider who pays for your housing, food, clothes, and any other expenses you have. Child support payments are considered financial support. If child support payments cover more than half of your financial support, then the parent paying child support should be the one included on your FAFSA. If you're still not sure you can ask your parents."}
{"text": "Q: can i have a list of things i will need specifically\nA: To start the FAFSA, you will need your FSA ID and some documents like 2022 tax returns and bank account info. If you need to include parent info on the FAFSA, you'll also need to collect some information from them. Here is a checklist to help you get started https://www.uaspire.org/FAFSA. Pro tip: If you and your parent(s) consent, the IRS will automatically share income and tax info with the FAFSA, reducing the number of questions you must answer."}
{"text": "Q: how do EFC and SAI compare\nA: Student Aid Index (SAI) has replaced Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as the number the FAFSA calculates. SAI is very similar to EFC and will determine what federal financial aid you can receive; your state and college may use it too. SAI can be as low as -1,500, and it no longer considers whether you have siblings in college in the calculation. If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}
{"text": "Q: Where can my parents find scholarships reported as income on their tax forms\nA: You would only have a scholarship reported on your taxes if you or someone in your household was in college in 2022 and received a scholarship that was considered taxable income. Taxable scholarships can appear in two places on the 2022 1040 tax form. Look for \"SCH\" with a dollar amount to the left of line 1a on the 1040 or line 8r on Schedule 1 (if you have one). If you see a number greater than 0 in either place, you should report it on the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: Does the parent have to report if they own a business\nA: Assets on the FAFSA can include savings and checking accounts, investment accounts, real estate, businesses, and farms.

You should NOT include retirement accounts or the home you live in. If you're the beneficiary of a 529 plan and not the account owner, don't include it in the student asset section."}
{"text": "Q: can i skip the questions about assets\nA: You should answer all questions the form asks to make sure you can submit and get it processed without any issues. If you meet certain income and tax filing conditions or receive specific federal benefits, the FAFSA will automatically skip questions about your assets. The FAFSA will only ask questions that are relevant to you based on your responses."}

If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}
{"text": "Q: How much money do I get this year\nA: Financial aid can change yearly depending on the info you report on your financial aid forms, your college's financial aid practices, your grades and attendance, and other factors. For example, if your income from 2022 is lower than 2021, your SAI may decrease, meaning you may be eligible for more financial aid than last year. If you're offered less financial aid on your award letter than last year, talk to your college to understand why."}
{"text": "Q: what is the earned income tax credit\nA: The Earned Income Tax Credit (EIC) is a tax credit from the IRS that you can receive if you are working and have earned income below a certain amount. You can determine if an EIC was received by looking at line 27 on the 2022 1040 tax forms. If there is an amount greater than 0 on line 27, an EIC was received, and you should say 'Yes' if asked on the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: sar\nA: The FAFSA Submission Summary has replaced the Student Aid Report (SAR) as the summary of the information you put on the FAFSA.

{"text": "Q: getting to it\nA: Got it. Don't lose time - set aside time to get started soon! And if you need any help, you can always ask me a question."}
{"text": "Q: Understanding the cost of attending college\nA: College costs are hard to predict and vary based on the college, the financial aid you receive, and many other factors. Filling out the FAFSA is a great first step to getting financial aid to help you pay for college. If you'd like more information on different colleges, their costs, and the financial aid they provide, check out https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/"}
{"text": "Q: What specific tax details are disclosed by the IRS\nA: If you filed 2022 taxes, the IRS will share specific lines from the tax form, like adjusted gross income, income tax paid, and several others. If you didn't file taxes, the IRS will share that they have no information on file for you. Either way, you and any other contributors should provide consent for the IRS to share federal tax information with your FAFSA. Consenting will ensure you are eligible for federal financial aid."}
{"text": "Q: Can I use my cell phone to fill it out\nA: If you don't have access to a computer with WiFi, you can complete the FAFSA using your mobile device by navigating to https://fafsa.gov on your mobile internet browser."}
{"text": "Q: what if i leave a question blank\nA: You should answer all questions the form asks to make sure you can submit and get it processed without any issues. If you meet certain income and tax filing conditions or receive specific federal benefits, the FAFSA will automatically skip questions about your assets. The FAFSA will only ask questions that are relevant to you based on your responses."}
{"text": "Q: I forgot my password for my FSA id, what should i do\nA: Don't worry! If you need to edit your name, social security number, date of birth, email, or phone number associated with your FSA ID, you can log in and edit it by going to https://fafsa.gov/ and clicking 'Settings' on your dashboard. Make sure your Social Security number and name match your Social Security card and your date of birth is correct."}
{"text": "Q: do my parents do the fafsa before me\nA: Either you or your parent can start the FAFSA. In the beginning, you can select that you are a 'Student,' or if your parent is starting it, they can select they are a 'Parent.' Depending on who starts the FAFSA, the other person will need to be invited as a contributor and provide certain information to complete the FAFSA. Once you invite someone as a contributor, they can log in and complete their section."}
{"text": "Q: where ca i find the signature page i used to submit for my mom\nA: The signature page is no longer an option for the 2024-25 FAFSA. A parent without an SSN can now create an FSA ID and use it to sign the FAFSA. If your parent cannot create an FSA ID, you can complete a paper FAFSA, have your parent(s) sign it, and mail it in. Your parent(s) will still need to verify their identify after it processes. The paper FAFSA is available in English and Spanish at https://studentaid.gov/forms-library/."}
{"text": "Q: My parents can not access my fafsa form\nA: To invite your parent(s) to your FAFSA, you must provide their name, date of birth, Social Security number (SSN), email address, and mailing address (if no SSN).

{"text": "Q: Do you think I should apply for the direct unsubsidized loan\nA: You should only choose to 'apply for a direct unsubsidized loan only' if you are considered a dependent student, but your parent(s) refuse to provide their information on your FAFSA. If you select this option, you will not be eligible for any other federal financial aid unless your parent(s) provide their information. You should contact your college and explain your parent's refusal to see if they would allow you to apply as an independent student. "}
{"text": "Q: Is there an option to save and revisit\nA: If you can't finish the FAFSA all at once, don't worry. It will save as you go through the form, and you can return to finish it. If you leave it inactive for more than 45 days, the system will delete it, and you'll have to start again."}
{"text": "Q: Is consenting helpful\nA: Anyone filling out a section of your FAFSA must consent for you to be eligible for federal financial aid. Even if you or your parent(s) didn't file 2022 taxes, consent is still required. If taxes weren't filed, the IRS will share with the FAFSA that they have no tax info on file.\n\nIf you or your parent(s) don't consent, you will NOT receive federal financial aid. If anyone didn't consent, they should log back in at https://fafsa.gov and provide consent."}
{"text": "Q: What is the deadline for the FAFSA\nA: You should fill it out as soon as possible! Each state and college has its own deadline and many are in early 2024.

Check the college website for their deadline and check out your state deadlines here: https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/fafsa-deadlines."}
{"text": "Q: i don't know if it's completed\nA: Once your FAFSA is signed and submitted, you will see a confirmation page or email that will provide your SAI and estimated federal aid eligibility.

{"text": "Q: why does the website kick me out\nA: The 2024-25 FAFSA is experiencing some technical issues. If you are unable to move past certain questions, you can try using a different device/browser or try again later. If it continues not to work, you have the option to delete the form and start over.

Don't worry; this process is normal."}
{"text": "Q: I share a phone with my siblings. Do I need my own\nA: A phone number is not required to create an FSA ID. If you have your own mobile phone number, we recommend using it to have it as an option for two-factor authentication and password recovery."}
{"text": "Q: how do i get my parent to aid with my FAFSA\nA: If you can, you should encourage your parents to provide their information so you can be considered for as many sources of aid as possible! Your parents won't be required to pay for your college, and it doesn't put them at any risk.\n\nIf they refuse, you may only be able to apply for a direct unsubsidized loan. Follow the guidance here: https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/parent-info#unwilling-parents"}
{"text": "Q: My parents didn't graduate high school. Should I report that on the FAFSA\nA: The FAFSA asks for parent education status to help determine whether you are a first-generation college student (part of the first generation in your family to attend college). You should select the answer that best represents your parent(s) education level and choose 'Don't know' if you are unsure. "}
{"text": "Q: do all schools require it\nA: Whether or not the FAFSA is required depends on the state you live in.

{"text": "Q: i messed up and put the wrong contributor, how can i fix it\nA: If you entered an incorrect name, DOB, or SSN for a contributor, log in to the FAFSA and correct it. If you entered an incorrect email, it's okay as long as the other items match. Once they log in with their FSA ID, they'll see the invite to your FAFSA.\n\nIf your FAFSA was submitted with the wrong contributor, you can fix it once it processes by making a correction. It will need to be resubmitted with the new contributor's info."}
{"text": "Q: Will the FAFSA changes make it easier\nA: The FAFSA has undergone changes required by federal legislation to simplify and reduce the questions, making it better for students and families.

{"text": "Q: my dad passed away last year but i live with my stepmother\nA: I'm really sorry to hear that. If one parent has passed away, you should only report the info for your living parent.

The FSA ID acts as your legal signature and what you'll use to log into and complete the FAFSA each year."}
{"text": "Q: my housing plan is different for different schools, can i show that on fafsa\nA: The FAFSA no longer asks for your housing status for each college you are applying to. Colleges will likely follow up to understand where you will be living while attending their college. It is really important to respond if you receive any requests from the college asking about housing. This will help make your financial aid offers more accurate when you receive them. Always check to make sure the college has the correct housing status for you. "}
{"text": "Q: can i skip questions if i dont know the answer\nA: You should answer all questions the form asks to make sure you can submit and get it processed without any issues.

{"text": "Q: do I do the fafsa first or my mom\nA: Either you or your parent can start the FAFSA. In the beginning, you can select that you are a 'Student,' or if your parent is starting it, they can select they are a 'Parent.'

{"text": "Q: Does being pregnant affect your FAFSA\nA: Being pregnant does not automatically make you independent on the FAFSA.

Don't worry; this process is normal."}
{"text": "Q: how does the role thing work this year\nA: Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section. Because the FAFSA has switched to role-based completion, each contributor needs to be invited to your FAFSA. This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}
{"text": "Q: if i haven't all lied to a school yet? can i still say yes that i applied on the scholarship application\nA: You can submit the FAFSA before you apply to college.

{"text": "Q: do i make a new fafsa application if my mom has a fafsa id already\nA: If you are applying as a dependent, you and your parent(s) will need separate FSA IDs to complete your respective section.

This question will help the college determine your eligibility for certain types of financial aid. "}
{"text": "Q: how do I know if I'm a legal resident of a state\nA: Your state of legal residence is where your permanent home is. If you go to school in a state different from your home state, be sure to list the home state, not the state you attend school in. If you live separately from your parent(s) for another reason, list your home address. \n\nFor the date of residence, you should list the month and year that you moved to the state.

{"text": "Q: how is SAI different from EFC\nA: Student Aid Index (SAI) has replaced Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as the number the FAFSA calculates. SAI is very similar to EFC and will determine what federal financial aid you can receive; your state and college may use it too.

If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}

{"text": "Q: what is tax-exempt income\nA: Tax-exempt interest refers to interest income that is not subject to taxation, such as municipal bonds. If you need to provide tax information manually on the FAFSA, you can find it on your 1040, line 2a.

{"text": "Q: how can my dad determine the net worth of his farm\nA: Net worth is the value of an asset minus any debt you own on that asset. To determine the net worth of a business, farm, or real estate (like a vacation home or rental property), you would take the value you could sell it for and subtract any debt. If you rent out a part of the home you live in, you only report the net worth of that part. We recommend talking to an accountant if you have questions."}

{"text": "Q: Does my parent need an email address to create an FSA ID\nA: An email address is required to create an FSA ID. If you don't have one, you can create a free one via Google or Yahoo. Make sure to use an email address you'll have access to throughout college.

{"text": "Q: Does the FAFSA ask questions about assets\nA: You might not see any or only see very few financial questions on the FAFSA. Due to the new consent process, the IRS shares most income and tax information directly with the FAFSA, so you don't need to answer the questions. In addition, if you receive federal benefits or your income is below a certain amount, the FAFSA will automatically skip any questions about your assets."}

{"text": "Q: My dad remarried and then he died\nA: I'm really sorry to hear that. If one parent has passed away, you should only report the info for your living parent.

For example, if your income from 2022 is lower than 2021, your SAI may decrease, meaning you may be eligible for more financial aid than last year.

If you are still waiting for information and can't submit it, call your college and tell them why. "}
{"text": "Q: Does the FAFSA ask questions about taxes\nA: You might not see any or only see very few financial questions on the FAFSA.

{"text": "Q: SAI vs EFC\nA: Student Aid Index (SAI) has replaced Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as the number the FAFSA calculates. SAI is very similar to EFC and will determine what federal financial aid you can receive; your state and college may use it too. SAI can be as low as -1,500, and it no longer considers whether you have siblings in college in the calculation. If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}
{"text": "Q: What happens if knowledge questions Are Not answered correctly\nA: For people without an SSN, knowledge-based verification questions are required to further prove identity.

You should review it for errors and ensure all your colleges are listed. If you notice any errors, you can make a correction."}
{"text": "Q: Why are there roles on the fafsa this year\nA: Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section.

{"text": "Q: family size is different from my taxes\nA: Family size should be updated if the number of people claimed on the 2022 taxes is different than the number currently in the household.

To see who is claimed on the tax forms, count the tax filer, spouse (if applicable), and anyone in the dependent section. Here's a picture that shows where to look.\n\nIf you're unsure, update it on the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: how do i answer the tax questions\nA: A tax return is a form you complete yearly to report your income to the government.

Other states may require you to fill out a separate application to receive state financial aid. Check to see what your state requires."}
{"text": "Q: Where do I list taxable scholarships\nA: You should NOT report the financial aid you received last year as income on your FAFSA.

{"text": "Q: Can I do it without an email\nA: An email address is required to create an FSA ID. If you don't have one, you can create a free one via Google or Yahoo.

Your responses to the asset questions won't impact your aid eligibility if your parents' income or federal benefits exempt you from reporting assets."}
{"text": "Q: does the fafsa submission summary show all of the schools I've applied to\nA: Once your FAFSA is processed and you've received your FAFSA Submission Summary, you can see the colleges that have received your FAFSA on the School Information tab.

You do not need to report these elsewhere on the FAFSA."}
{"text": "Q: i don't meet any of the unusual circumstances. but my parents won't help me\nA: If you can, you should encourage your parents to provide their information so you can be considered for as many sources of aid as possible! Your parents won't be required to pay for your college, and it doesn't put them at any risk.\n\nIf they refuse, you may only be able to apply for a direct unsubsidized loan. Follow the guidance here: https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/parent-info#unwilling-parents"}

{"text": "Q: my family has a vacation home but how do i know what the net worth is\nA: Net worth is the value of an asset minus any debt you own on that asset. To determine the net worth of a business, farm, or real estate (like a vacation home or rental property), you would take the value you could sell it for and subtract any debt. If you rent out a part of the home you live in, you only report the net worth of that part. We recommend talking to an accountant if you have questions."}
{"text": "Q: I don't have a home address to put\nA: You should use an address where you can receive mail throughout the year.

{"text": "Q: Will my housing status impact the amount of financial aid I receive\nA: The FAFSA no longer asks for your housing status for each college you are applying to. Colleges will likely follow up to understand where you will be living while attending their college.

Always check to make sure the college has the correct housing status for you. "}

As long as you provided consent, having to answer income and tax questions is not a cause for concern."}
{"text": "Q: DACA\nA: If you have DACA status, you are not eligible for federal financial aid. Whether or not you should complete the FAFSA depends on your state and the colleges you apply to.

{"text": "Q: i didn't work in 2019, so do i still need the tax returns\nA: If you earned some money in 2022 but didn't file taxes, you will NOT need to report it on your FAFSA. You won't need your W-2 to report any information. If you did file taxes, the IRS will share your income/tax information directly if you provided your consent when starting the FAFSA. Whether you filed taxes or not, you should consent so the IRS can share your information with the FAFSA. This consent is mandatory to qualify for federal financial aid."}
{"text": "Q: fafsa 2021-2022 or 2020-2021\nA: If you're planning to go to college in the fall of 2024, you should fill out the 2024-25 FAFSA by going to https://fafsa.gov. \n\n Do not fill out the 2023-24 FAFSA unless you're currently in college AND haven't filled out a FAFSA for fall 2023 or planning to go to college in the spring of 2024.

{"text": "Q: Should my parents report the number on schedule C if it's negative\nA: 2022 Schedule C is a tax form that many business owners file.

{"text": "Q: income tax\nA: Income tax paid is the amount in federal tax payments for the given tax year. You can find income tax paid on line 22 of the 2022 1040 tax form. On the FAFSA, you must subtract Schedule 2 line 2 from line 22 of the 1040. If a Schedule 2 wasn't filed, or there was no amount on line 2, report the amount on line 22 of the 1040."}
{"text": "Q: Could you verify if my consent was approved\nA: As long as you click the 'approve' button on the consent page of your FAFSA, you should be all set. The FAFSA won't tell you what information was shared, but after submitting, you should review the FAFSA submission summary to ensure everything was processed correctly."}
{"text": "Q: can I see my submission summary answers\nA: To see your answers on the FAFSA, you will need to go to the 'FAFSA Form Answers' tab in your FAFSA Submission Summary, which you'll receive after your FAFSA processes. You will be able to see your answers and those provided by any contributors (parent or spouse). If you provided consent when starting the FAFSA, information from the IRS will not appear here. You can only see manually answered income/tax questions."}
{"text": "Q: My parents file taxes somewhere else. Do I report in on the FAFSA\nA: If you or your parent(s) are a foreign tax filer, earned money in a foreign country but did not file a tax return, or filed a tax return in Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory, income and tax info must be manually provided on the FAFSA. Convert currency amounts to U.S. dollars and do your best to align the information on your tax return to the questions asked. Colleges will ask for additional info to confirm what was entered."}
{"text": "Q: What if my parents didn't get an invite\nA: If you entered an incorrect name, DOB, or SSN for a contributor, log in to the FAFSA and correct it. If you entered an incorrect email, it's okay as long as the other items match. Once they log in with their FSA ID, they'll see the invite to your FAFSA.\n\nIf your FAFSA was submitted with the wrong contributor, you can fix it once it processes by making a correction. It will need to be resubmitted with the new contributor's info."}
{"text": "Q: Can I leave a question blank\nA: You should answer all questions the form asks to make sure you can submit and get it processed without any issues. If you meet certain income and tax filing conditions or receive specific federal benefits, the FAFSA will automatically skip questions about your assets. The FAFSA will only ask questions that are relevant to you based on your responses."}
{"text": "Q: issues with mailing address\nA: You cannot edit your mailing address in the FAFSA.

You should change it to ensure everything is up to date."}
{"text": "Q: can you explain the purpose of inviting parents\nA: Role-based completion means each contributor (usually a parent or spouse) who is required to provide information on your FAFSA must log in and complete their own section. Because the FAFSA has switched to role-based completion, each contributor needs to be invited to your FAFSA. This change was made due to federal legislation and will help keep your information and your parents' information more secure."}

If you see a significant change in SAI from EFC, you should talk to your college to understand why."}
