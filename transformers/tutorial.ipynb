    "These sentences are slightly different but their vector representations of embeddings are identical.  We introduce positional encoding to address this issue.  It incorperates information about the position of each embedding within a sequence.  Positional encoding is added to the input embeddings, enabling the model to diffrentiate between the positions of various elements in the input sequence.\n",

An oscillation refers to a single cycle of a wave, moving from the highest point to the lowest point and back to the highest point. The number of oscillations refers to how many times the wave cycles within the positional encoding. Each sine and cosine wave controls the number of oscillations for each wave, and these waves are added to different dimensions of the word embeddings. This process allows the model to encode positional information within each embedding. Each one of these waves is added to a different dimension in the word embedding.\n",

    "Positional encoding can be conceptualized as a series of vectors, where each vector captures a specific location within the sequence. When this poitional vector is added to its corresponding embedding vector, the combination preservces the positional information, ensuring the elements sequence order is maintained within the resulting vector.  In models such as GPT, positional encodings are not static but rather learnable paramters.  These learning params, represented by tensors, are added to the embedding vector and optimized during training.  \n",
