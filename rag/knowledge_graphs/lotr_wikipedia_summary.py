Bilbo Baggins celebrates his birthday and leaves the Ring to Frodo, his heir. 
Gandalf (a wizard) suspects it is a Ring of Power; seventeen years later, he confirms it was lost by the 
Dark Lord Sauron and counsels Frodo to take it away from the Shire. Gandalf leaves, promising to return, 
but fails to do so. Frodo sets out on foot with his cousin Pippin Took and gardener Sam Gamgee.

who frees them and gives them ancient swords from the wight's hoard. The Hobbits reach the village of Bree,
where they meet Strider, a Ranger. The innkeeper gives Frodo an old letter from Gandalf,

The Council of Elrond discusses what to do with the Ring. Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, 
the heir of Isildur who had cut the Ring from Sauron's hand in the Second Age, but claimed it for himself. 
The Ring was lost when Isildur was killed; it passed to Gollum and then to Bilbo. 
Gandalf reports that the chief wizard, Saruman, is a traitor. The Council decides that the Ring must 
be destroyed in the fire of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged. Frodo takes this task upon himself.

The others escape to the Elvish forest of Lothlórien, where the Lady Galadriel tests their loyalty,

River Anduin. At Amon Hen, Boromir tries to take the Ring, but Frodo puts on the Ring and disappears.

taking Pippin with him.

Sam overhears Gollum debating with his alter ego, Sméagol, whether to steal the Ring.
